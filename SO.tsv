43264418	How to phrase requirements around cyber security?	I'm stuck trying to write software requirements around cyber security.  I'm designing a system where two devices communicate over Bluetooth, and (for example) I am going to (1) enable the BLE feature to help guard against Man-in-the-Middle attacks, and (2) add more code to make it even less likely.  Where I'm stuck, is writing the requirement for this feature.  I can't say 'The app shall prevent Man-in-the-Middle attacks' because that's not testable.  I can't say 'The app shall work really hard to prevent Man-in-the-Middle attacks' because it sounds stupid and is not testable.  I have similar problems writing the requirements for the code I'm implementing to guard against Denial of Service attacks and general eavesdropping.  Note that I'm not asking how to do this in Bluetooth - I'm looking for help in writing the requirements document for this application so that the resulting requirements are 'Unambiguous, Testable (verifiable), Clear (concise, terse, simple, precise), Correct, Understandable, Feasible (realistic, possible), Independent, and Atomic.'

55077140	How to write structured, testable requirements on software API?	Could you please give some guidance on how to write structured, testable requirements on software API (functions)?  For example, let's look at the following documentation:  _Unwind_Reason _Unwind_RaiseException( struct _Unwind_Exception *exception_object );  Raise an exception, passing along the given exception object, which should have its exception_class and exception_cleanup fields set. The exception object has been allocated by the language-specific runtime, and has a language-specific format, except that it must contain an _Unwind_Exception struct (see Exception Header above). _Unwind_RaiseException does not return, unless an error condition is found (such as no handler for the exception, bad stack format, etc.). In such a case, an _Unwind_Reason_Code value is returned. Possibilities are:  - _URC_END_OF_STACK: The unwinder encountered the end of the stack during phase 1, without finding a handler. The unwind runtime will not have modified the stack. The C++ runtime will normally call uncaught_exception() in this case.  - _URC_FATAL_PHASE1_ERROR: The unwinder encountered an unexpected error during phase 1, e.g. stack corruption. The unwind runtime will not have modified the stack. The C++ runtime will normally call terminate() in this case.  If the unwinder encounters an unexpected error during phase 2, it should return _URC_FATAL_PHASE2_ERROR to its caller.   This is a documentation. It must be translated into a set (hierarchical list?) of requirements, and each requirement must have its own unique id and must be clearly testable.   I will be very grateful for your advice! 	TRUE

54842534	Shall Statement System Function Requirements vs Use Cases	Question: Why do system/software development businesses favor use case requirements over shall statement system requirements?    Comparison:    Functional requirements of a system is generally defined with either of:  1-traditional shall statement system requirements  2-use cases (textual or diagram)  Both of these approaches are tried to be used such to provide system requirements as treating the system as 'black box', i.e. the requirements should not to define sub-system detail.  I feel traditional shall statements are abandoned, however i also think them are well-defining for the system. I do not find use-cases by nature as a way of writing SMART or good requirements. They are either not atomic, not testable, defining or depended to other system behavior, over-defining system, or defining sub-system behavior to define system interactions. I think, traditional shall statement requirements are better by their atomic nature for requirement management. However, i have seen it is also criticized as difficult to complete, when completed difficult to adapt to changes. I argue otherwise. They might be difficult to complete, but you have to have complete requirements. You might not start with a complete set, but you can complete, as you go. I do not also think they are hard to adapt changes. I think, with use cases, single change is more prone to effect other parts of requirements. But good shall-statement requirements are supposed to be atomic. With a traceable requirement management, for example any change in interfaces, can easily point to which requirements to change/remove/add. You can even abstract your requirements from the interface detail, by using symbols for interface elements, in order to increase your ability to adapt changes in interfaces.    EXAMPLE:    I want to further elaborate with the following example. For the sake of simplicity, the functional definition will be small.  Let's say, i have a system consisting of 4 subsystems. System1 controls system2. System2 controls system3 and system4. System2 has the capability of powering on and off System3 and System4. System1 sends message1 to system2, for controlling system3. System1 sends message2 to system2, for controlling system4. The system that i need to define is system2.   Use case approach:  MAIN FLOW   system2 receives 'message1' message from 'system1' (Alternative statement: system1 sends 'message1' to system2.) system2 receives 'power on system3'. system2 powers on 'system3' system2 receives 'message2' message from 'system1' (Alternative statement: system1 sends 'message2' to system2.) system2 receives 'power on system4'. system2 powers on 'system4'.   Alternative Flow1(MF.2):  1. system2 receives 'power off system3'.  2. system2 powers off 'system3'  Alternative Flow2(MF.4):  1. system2 receives 'power off system4'.  2. system2 powers off 'system4'  Shall Statement Requirements:  REQ1: 'System2' shall power on 'system3', if 'system1' applied 'power on system3' with message 'message1'.  REQ2: 'System2' shall power off 'system3', if 'system1' applied 'power off system3' with message 'message1'.  REQ3: 'System2' shall power on 'system4', if 'system1' applied 'power on system4' with message 'message2'.  REQ4: 'System2' shall power off 'system4', if 'system1' applied 'power off system4' with message 'message2'.  Note: I would even combine REQ1 and REQ2 as one requirement, and REQ3 and REQ4 as one requirement, since they are two distinct set of requirements, whose union defines every condition applied by the user system ('system1').  I think that a requirement should be clear, realizable, testable, not-conflicting with other requirements, time-bound if necessary, not-defining with subsystem behavior, not over-defining, not-defining behavior of other interacting systems, defining in which condition it is fulfilled. I think the shall-statement requirements are good enough. You can simply realize them and just write simple test-cases and verify the system.  For the use case statements, i think, we have to define if each of the steps in the main flow is a requirement, or if the whole scenario is one single requirement.  If each of the steps is a requirement, then i think step 1,2 defines other system behavior if it is written in alternative way, and they are not testable, since only way to test is to ask the system if it received the message. step 3. could be okay, but what we want is that requirement to be fulfilled if step 1&amp;2 happened before. Since step3 does not reference step1&amp;2, step3 cannot be a standalone requirement.  I think we should regard all of them as one single requirement. I find this view is more feasible, nevertheless i think, this view has pitfalls too.   Still step 1. is defining other system behavior, or dependent on it. You might argue otherwise by saying it is a precondition of the whole scenario, but in that case step 4. is also defining other system behavior. I think the requirements should not depend on what other systems are supposed to do, rather define all-cases not depending to other systems.   Furthermore, since the use case is a sequence, now we are also defining 'power system3' operations are before 'power system4' operations. But in the role of a system engineer, that is not something i want to define for system2. System2 should process in which order, the orders came. Sequencing these operations is over-defining and sub-system behavior, to-me.  I tried to make the example simple. But in extensive real life scenarios, use cases are generally long, they have to define unnecessary sub-system behavior in order to be able to define system interactions, not atomic, not testable or generating test-cases is not as natural as it is with shall-statement requirements, which are atomic. Since the use-cases are long, they are composed of multiple atomic shall-statement requirements. If whole long scenario of a use case of lots of atomic requirements is seen as one single requirement, then when the related test-case fails, then how to pinpoint and document the problem.  	TRUE
169765	How do you get non-technical folks to appreciate a non-UI problem?	Suppose you're working on an enterprise project in which you have to get management signoff in order for you to develop a new feature set. Usually your management has no problem signing off on some bright shiny new UI feature. Unfortunately they have a hard time appreciating some behind-the-scenes issues that are crucial to the application's well-being such as transactions, data integrity, workflow routing, configurability, security, etc. Since they're non-technical and these issues are not immediately visible, it's not obvious to them that this is crucial.

13673163	android minimum hardware specs for dev machine - can i code using a notebook?	So far I have been developing directly on my galaxy nexus and nexus 7 using the amazing AID app.  However, as the N7 can't provide logs due to it being jelly bean, i feel the need to get a mini notebook in order to utilise adb logcat.  My main worry is that something with only 1gb (2gb if i upgrade, which i will) and a 1.5-1.83GHz atom CPU won't be powerful enough.  I can possibly get around certain worries by not using emulators and testing directly on my two devices, so that will save me a great deal. Also I am tempted to just use vim and command line tools instead of eclipse which again might save me from a slow PC.  What do you guys think? Is the notebook way under powered? What if i just use vim and no emulators?   Side note, does anyone actually code in vim/command line?

2371152	What&#39;s the best way to link formal specs to JIRA enhancement requests?	What's the best way to link formal specs to JIRA enhancement requests?  I want to track changes to specifications using JIRA.  Ideally, I'd like to refer to a functional ID reference in a JIRA ticket (e.g. MYAPP>APPROVAL LOGIC>MAIN SCREEN), so that program managers can retrospectively categorise defects.   The reason for this, is so that QA scripts and documentation tickets can be searched/categorised meaningfully in the tracking system.  There seems to be a million possible ways to do this, e.g.    should I write a custom component to select functional IDs from a tree? should I write the specs in confluence, or another CMS with a TrackBack facility? should I include a link to the documentation URL? should I use some other 3rd party plugin application? should I use some Atlassian application that i'm unaware of? am I using the wrong tracking tool/process to measure spec growth?   What's the best way, in your experience?    Thanks for the reply!  There is another option that I'm considering, which is to implement the functional requirement as an actual ticket.   This makes a lot of sense (to me at least), because a functional requirements have owners, a lifecycle, and a clear concept of sub tickets for simple enhancements etc. The ability to link issues allows it to be connected to QA activities, documentation tickets, or any other kind of work. Functional requirements also link together, so the model fits.  The problem with this approach, is that unless you want to create every defect ticket as a sub-task to a requirement (and forgo additional subtask functionality), you have to create, and then link the ticket, using the standard 'link ticket' functionality, which isn't very quick to use. This is a high resistance workflow, which means it requires a lot of discipline.   I'd ideally like to be able to create a ticket, that is automatically linked to another ticket, similarly to the functionality of linking a sub ticket.  I can't be the first person to want to do this - I don't suppose you know of anyone who has tried this that you know of, or released a tool to making this easier?

33263934	IBM Rational DOORS: How to paste as plain text in DOORS Objects?	While writing requirements in IBM DOORS, is it possible to paste some text as plain text (i.e. without original text's formatting) in the 'Heading' or 'Text' attribute of a DOORS Object?  A simple paste operation keeps the original text formatting that reduces the readability of respective DOORS module. Ofcourse it's possible to copy in notepad first, but I am curious to know if there's a possibility to do it within DOORS.

51535618	Best practices for including large resource folder into java project	I'm working on a project where having access to a big resource folder (structure with thousand of little images) is required. The client want to offer the app through a native installation (which includes the JVM that the app require to run). He doesn't want to pack that resources as a folder in the app because it would create a folder structure as big as the original in the final user's hard drive (the folder doesn't take much space but it has many little files), plus the folder could be stealed easily by simply copying it. Giving this, I can't package all the app with a resource folder in a jar file, as far as i know jar files are not installables. Another requirement is that client needs certain flexibility to add some files in a installed app folders structure to add new features to the program. So an installation is the only way (i think) to obtain this.  I've tried to pack them in a jar file, include it in the build path and tried to access it but i failed even with all the research i've made through various sites.  Tried getResources() in a million ways but it was impossible to get a simple directory inside the jar file meanwhile doing it from a folder outside the jar is really easy. I need to get access to a directory in order to get a list of files it cointains.  Arrived to this point. I've started to ask myself if i'm facing this problem on the best way so i wanted to ask you all: how would you package the resources you need in a native java app with this requirements?  I'm even thinking about create some kind of encryption proccess to create a single file with all the information and simply temporarily decrypt it when needed at runtime but i think there would be a simpler and cleaner way to face this.  Thank you in advance  EDIT: As you asked for, i'm adding the code of what i've tried:  this is the project structure  project ├───src │   ├───main │   │   └───java │   │       ├───model &lt;--- where my class is │   │       ├───controllers │   │       ├───utilities │   │       └───views │   ├───resources &lt;--- this is where is (formerly) accessed the content i need |   |   ├─── jarfile.jar &lt;--- i've placed file here and included to build path │   │   └───-various folders and files - │   └───test └───target   inside the jar file there are the packages src.resources.blalblaba and inside of this, the folder i need  Way1:   getResources replacing jar file '.' with '/' tried with paths: 'src/resources/blablabla/folderINeed','src/resources/src/resources/blablabla' (due to possible duplicity), 'folderINeed', 'blablabla/folderINeed'  -> URI always get NullPointerException with message 'null'  public void loadContent(String contentPath) throws Exception {      File resources= null;     File[] listFiles = null;      URI uri = getClass().getClassLoader().getResource(contentPath).toURI();     resources= new File(uri);     listFiles = resources.listFiles();      //do some file proccessing and load them }   Way 2: paths used 'folderINeed','src/resources/blablabla/folderINeed','blablabla/folderINeed','../../../resources/blablabla/folderINeed' &lt;--- URL return null but, at least, doesn't raise a NullPointerException.  public void loadContent(String contentPath) throws Exception {      // conseguimos todas las carpetas de animaciones     File resources;     File[] listFiles = null;      URL url = MyClass.class.getResource(contentPath);     if (url == null) {          // error - missing folder     } else {         resources = new File(url.toURI());         listFiles = resources.listFiles();     } }   Way 3: some complex code using class JarFile that didn't work for me and was oriented to get a simple file, not a folder.

52849063	Searching for free requirements management software	I am looking for a requirements management software, like DOORS, but for free (I need to enter requirements, and generate a specification document, not only follow requirement traceability like reqtify allows you to do) I searched on the Internet, and I found the nearly perfect sofware : GenSpec. Moreover, GenSpec use templates with standards, like IEEE 830 which is the one I am interested in.  I said 'nearly perfect' because the document generation does not work in GenSpec (runtime error). So I tried to subscribe to the google group to ask some assistance, but I think it is an old software which is not supported and updated anymore (for info, I downloaded GenSpec 6.8.40 and I work with Microsoft Office 2016, I think there is a compatibility issue, but it is only an hypothesis)  So I am posting this subject here if someone can :   Either tell me if there is a similar software ? Or, knows GenSpec and can perhaps help me with my document generation issue (I could give more details in this case) ?   Thanks ! 	TRUE

52858824	How do we gather and document non-functional requirements in Agile	I know in waterfall, they are gathered and documented at an early stage of SDLC, I believe very first stage. Therefore, they are captured and documented before development and testing even starts.  But I am confused how is that done in Agile?   If I understand correctly, user stories should be written with acceptance criteria which capture non-functional requirements. But in Agile, we pick project, create it, and start working on it right away.    So, my guess is that someone (perhaps product owner) goes through user stories and collects acceptance criteria into a formatted document which then becomes Non-Functional-Requirements document? 	TRUE

52697317	What is the minimum server requirement for app like whatsapp using webrtc application	I want to build an app like Whatsapp including audio/video call feature for my company of around 1,000 users. I've a very less idea on it. I think the app (based on android and iOS) will be developed using webrtc as my developers are saying. I also want to build my own server to run this application. So I need some expert advice regarding this.   Does the application need any dedicated IPs? For 500 and 1,000 users, how much monthly bandwidth consumption should we look? (including audio and video call) What should be recommended server internet speed? What kind of a minimum server/processing power/ram/storage etc is recommended to run this application and service 500 - 1,000 users. If we go for cloud service instead, then which service provider and what configuration should we look for?   You are also welcome to advice out of the list. The information you provide need not to be accurate but should be a decent estimate. Thanks for your time! 	
52295210	Request to implement unique id property which is tested with single adding to set	I recently struggled with a programming task in a code challenge for a job interview invite: There was a class Flight with a property final String flightNo. Initially flightNo was passed in the constructor.  The task was to make sure that flight numbers are unique (without and further information) and to only change code in Flight. However, the groovy spock test (see https://www.baeldung.com/groovy-spock for further infos) tested  given:     Flight flight0 = new Flight('FN123')     FlightManager flightManager = ...     flightManager.addNewFlight(flight0) when:     Flight flight1 = new Flight('FN123')     boolean added = flightManager.addNewFlight(flight1) then:     !added   FlightManager.addNewFlight is adding Flights to a Set. I didn't have much time left and was new to the spock test syntax (meanwhile I like the idea).  Afterwards I found out that test pass if I implement Flight.equals and hashCode based on flightNo.  Is it correct to request uniqueness of flight numbers (without further information) when looking for the described solution? 	
52193141	Storing requirements/specification documents in TFS on-premise	We're starting a new development project using on-premise TFS 2018, git and Visual Studio. In the past we've followed the Agile model of creating epics and user stories and putting the requirements/ui mockups and other details directly in the user stories.  After living through that approach, we don't want go back down that road for the following reasons: 1) Once that feature is shipped, it becomes extremely difficult to locate the info. Who remembers what feature was done in what user story? 2) No centralized place to store feature documentation. Of course, we all don't want take the waterfall approach of spending 2 years writing feature requirements, but there is something to be said of having a centralized place organized by feature area that contains the relevant documentation. 3) Have you ever tried to read an extensive user story with requirements acceptance testing through either the web interface or through Visual Studio? It gets old pretty fast having to read through a 8 line window.  What we would like to do is do a hybrid of documentation and reference a link to the doc in the user story.  The user story exists for sprint tracking, but the details are stored in the document.  After the feature/user story has shipped, we can refer to the doc.  Therefore the question becomes how to store this type of info in TFS and link to it so it can open with a link in the user story.  We know we can do this with SharePoint, but is it possible to do in on-premise TFS? 	TRUE
52153676	What is the requirements for running a Rust compiled program on another Windows machine?	I'm totally new to Rust. I installed Rust on my Windows 10 machine. Created a simple helloworld program like this:  fn main() {     print!('Hello world!'); }   And compiled it with rustc rust.rs.

However, when I copy rust.exe to another newly created Windows 2016 virtual machine and run it, I got this error:    My question is, what's the requirement to run a Rust compiled program on a machine that doesn't have Rust installed? Do I need to install the vc++ build tools on it too (just as I did on the development machine)?  	
39745008	Should Multiple Actors share the same Goals in Actor-Goal list	Craig Larman states that creating an Actor[/User]-Goal list in form of some table/grid is a good technique for finding Use Cases during Requirements Analysis. (Applying UML and Patterns - P. 69 ff)  Some simple two-column table should be enough to provide a good Overview for this example; imagine following Actor-Goal List:  Actor    Goal                     Admin    Create User                '      Read User                  '      .. (full CRUD)             '      CRUD Entry                 '      Assign Entry (to User)     '      ..                        User     Create Entry               '      .. (full CRUD)             '      CRUD himself?              '      ..                        Admin can do what User can + more like managing the Users of the System under Development or assigning Entries to them.  Admin and User clearly are sharing some Goals(Can we use the term Use Case yet?).  Im not really sure where to go from here in terms of refining this Actor-Goal list.  My brain tells me that i can spare time and effort by reusing/abstraction here, so I will most likely end up with one common superclass implementing the CRUD Entry behaviour, where Admin is extending the functionality by the Manage Goals(CRUD User, assign, etc.).  But I know that this is rather a question of Design than Analysis. I also know that I can write the Use Case for this in isolation: I dont have to state who exactly uses it, I just need to know that it's some entity which is adhering to the given contract[/interface].   When is the time to start thinking about abstraction? Am I overcomplicating things by doing so right now? Should We leave the Actor-Goal list like above and check it off as a 'complete' Artifact?  Since the classical purpose of an Actor-Goal list is to provide some quick overview for our next Artifact - the Use Case Diagram - could we begin the transition right here?:   The Use Case Diagram makes the whole reusing part much more visible (at least to me). Would it be advisable to adopt the redundancy right now and take care of it during later stages (e.g. design)?  Appreciate your input!   EDIT: Also I'm not quite sure about the User CRUDing himself.. But lets keep things simple and stick to the main question. 	TRUE

52021074	why templated non const parameter constructor is preferred to given copy constructor	I want to make my class be able to be used in a std::variant.  The simply code that should work is:  int main() {     std::variant&lt; int, A &gt; v;      A a(1);     v = a; }   My class contains a templated constructor:   template &lt;typename T&gt; A( T&amp; );   At this point the trouble starts! The constructor binds to the call from std::variant and not the provided A(const A&amp;) is used anymore.  For copy&amp;paste reasons the full example here:  #include &lt;iostream&gt; #include &lt;variant&gt;  class A {     private:         int x;      public:          A( A&amp;&amp;) {}         A( const A&amp; ) {}         A(){}         ~A() {}          A&amp; operator=( const A&amp; ) { return *this;}         A&amp; operator=( A&amp;&amp; ) {return *this;}          template &lt;typename T&gt;             A( T&amp; t  )              {                 std::cout &lt;&lt; __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ &lt;&lt; std::endl;             }          A(int _x):x{_x}{} };  int main() {     std::variant&lt; int, A &gt; v;      A a(1);     v = a; }   Background:  Why the template here? The problem starts while using a constructor which takes a serializer type. The serializer can have multiple types, depends on files or streams to serialize with.  Remark: I know that the functionality of the constructors is missing!

15520832	Does a UML use can show everything the actor can do (functionality) or everything the actor wants to do (goals)?	Suppose we have a simple on-line store. Things that the user would want to achieve with the store would be:   Register (to create an account) Browse items Add items to basket Checkout and pay View account information Edit account information etc   However, there would be functionality that the user could initiate but wouldn't be their main goal of using the system:   Login Logout Select 'electronics' department Select 'vehicles' department Enter delivery details etc   I would argue that things like login and logout shouldn't be in the UML use case diagram. The reason being that a user would not want to go to the on-line store just to login; they would always have another aim which would be to view / edit account information or browse and buy stuff.  Likewise, the two select 'statements' are part of the browse items use case. I wouldn't use generalisation because there could be many departments.  Finally, the enter delivery details is part of the 'checkout' or 'edit account information' use case. I would normally lump this in with the 'edit account information' use case otherwise you may as well have use cases for 'edit name', 'edit email' etc.  My main concern is if you have a very complex use case diagram it defeats the purpose of having one as it won't be easy to read.  So, my question is as follows. Is my thinking behind this correct? Is it best to only model 'real' goals in the use case diagrams or everything that the actors can initiate? 	TRUE

6619313	IBM Rational DOORS: Use case extensions?	I'm investigating how to implement use case extension points in DOORS requirements. To this end, I wanted to know if a DOORS object in one module can reference or link to a DOORS object in a second module.

50963447	Swift - Conform third-party type to my own protocol with conflicting requirement	Here's the boiled down situation:  Let's say a third-party framework written by Alice Allman provides a very useful class:  public class AATrackpad {   public var cursorLocation: AAPoint = .zero }   and another framework written by Bob Bell provides a different class:  public class BBMouse {   public var where_is_the_mouse: BBPoint = .zero }   At runtime either one of these classes may be needed depending on which piece of hardware the user has decided to use. Therefore, in keeping with the Dependency Inversion Principle, I do not want my own types to depend on AATrackpad or BBMouse directly. Rather, I want to define a protocol which describes the behaviors I need:  protocol CursorInput {   var cursorLocation: CGPoint { get } }   and then have my own types make use of that protocol instead:  class MyCursorDescriber {   var cursorInput: CursorInput?    func descriptionOfCursor () -&gt; String {     return 'Cursor Location: \(cursorInput?.cursorLocation.description ?? 'nil')'   } }   I want to be able to use an instance of BBMouse as the cursor input, like this:  let myCursorDescriber = MyCursorDescriber() myCursorDescriber.cursorInput = BBMouse()   but in order for this to compile I have to retroactively conform BBMouse to my protocol:  extension BBMouse: CursorInput {   var cursorLocation: CGPoint {     return CGPoint(x: self.where_is_the_mouse.x, y: self.where_is_the_mouse.y)   } }   Now that I've conformed BBMouse to my CursorInput protocol, my code compiles and my architecture is the way I want it. The reason I have no problem here is that I think that where_is_the_mouse is a terrible name for that property, and I'm quite happy to never use that name again. However, with AATrackpad its a different story. I happen to think that Alice named her cursorLocation property perfectly, and as you can see I want to be able to use the same name for my protocol requirement. My problem is that AATrackpad does not use CGPoint as the type of this property, but instead uses a proprietary point type called AAPoint. The fact that my protocol requirement (cursorLocation) has the same name as an existing property of AATrackpad but a different type means that I can't retroactively conform to CursorInput:  extension AATrackpad: CursorInput {   var cursorLocation: CGPoint { // -- Invalid redeclaration     return CGPoint(x: self.cursorLocation.x, y: self.cursorLocation.y) // -- Infinite recursion   } }   As the comments in that snippet say, this code does not compile, and even if it did I'd be facing an infinite recursion at runtime because I have no way to specifically reference the AATrackpad version of cursorLocation. It would be great if something like this would work (self as? AATrackpad)?.cursorLocation, but I don't believe this makes sense in this context. Again though, the protocol conformance won't even compile in the first place, so disambiguating in order to solve the infinite recursion is secondary.  With all of that context in mind, my question is:  If I architect my app using protocols (which is widely recommended, for good reason), is it really true that my ability to use a certain third-party concrete type depends on the hope this third-party developer doesn't share my taste for naming conventions?    NOTE: The answer 'Just pick a name that doesn't conflict with the types you want to use' won't be satisfactory. Maybe in the beginning I only had BBMouse and had no conflicts, and then a year later I decided that I wanted to add support for AATrackpad as well. I initially chose a great name and it's now used pervasively throughout my app - should I have to change it everywhere for the sake of one new concrete type? What happens later on when I want to add support for CCStylusTablet, which now conflicts with whatever new name I chose? Do I have to change the name of my protocol requirement again? I hope you see why I'm looking for a more sound answer than that.

50522338	How to notify user that they can&#39;t run/install Laravel application because of file permission of storage/bootstrap directory?	So I've been working on this open source application called Faveo Helpdesk, which is built in Laravel. It has installer which checks server environment for requirements of Laravel and other required PHP extensions. It also has a check to verify permission for storage and bootstrap directories as they should be writable by web server according to Laravel Requirements.  The problem is the installer itself runs on Laravel and uses Laravel routes to show installation steps. And if the permissions are not correct on server it will not run and show installation steps as Laravel will not run in that case.  As many users face the same issue with the application and each time we need to guide/help them for checking and updating the permissions manually. I want to catch the exception and handle it by redirecting user to a normal php file where I'll show them the message to correct their file permission. Currently it simply shows browser error page giving no idea about the problem to users.  Is there a better way to handle this?

49067215	VBA: How to test if a string is Null	I am pretty new in VBA and I have not yet got used to the syntax completely, so I'm sorry if my question sounds stupid.  I am working with RequisitePro40 and VBA 7.0 in Word 2010. In one of my modules I have the following loop and If conditions:  Dim rqRequirements As ReqPro40.Requirements Dim rqRequirement As ReqPro40.Requirement Const eAttrValueLookup_Label = 4 Dim a As Integer ...  For Each vReqKey In rqRequirements     Set rqRequirement = rqRequirements(vReqKey)      If rqRequirement.AttrValue('MyAttreName', eAttrValueLookup_Label).text &lt;&gt; Null Then         a = 1     End If      If rqRequirement.AttrValue('MyAttreName', eAttrValueLookup_Label).text = Null Then          a = 2     End If   Next   In each iteration of the loop, both a = 1 and a = 2 are executed!!  Based on This, the equality and inequality operators are '=' and '&lt;>'. Therefore I would expect that either a = 1 or a = 2 execute for a string. Is there something wrong with my syntax? Or is it a ReqPro related Problem?  I also tried using 'Is' and 'IsNot' operators but they result in Compiler error: Type mismatch  Can Someone help me with this?  Update: The actual goal is to see if the     rqRequirement.AttrValue('MyAttreName', eAttrValueLookup_Label).text   is Null or not. I added the second if to show the problem that the statement is somehow not working the way I expect it to work.  Replacing 'Null' to 'vbNullString' did not make any changes.  I also tried the IsNull function as @Slai suggested. the result is pretty much the same:      If IsNull(rqRequirement.AttrValue(att, eAttrValueLookup_Label).text) Then         a = 3     End If      If Not IsNull(rqRequirement.AttrValue(att, eAttrValueLookup_Label).text) Then         a = 4     End If   Both statements a = 3 and a = 4 are true and executed. 	
15926758	Scalable VS Extensible	I'm not sure if this type of question is allowed here, but it is related to software projects.  Is there a difference between scalable and extensible?  Is extensible a sub-set of scalable? I.e. Scalable (extensible)  Some regard it as the same, others regard it as different. What are the differences?  I am led to believe:  Scalable - make the system withstand more usage (bandwidth etc...) AND make it larger.  Extensible - add more functionality to the system.  Are they not the same?  Edit: If extensible is adding more functionality to the system and scalable can be deemed as making a system larger, is that not theoretically the same, proving that extensible is just a sub-set of scalable? 	TRUE

28840	Scrum - How to get better input from the functional/commercial team	We are a small team of 3 developers (2 experienced but new to  this particular business sector) developing a functionally complex product.  We're using Scrum and have a demo at the end of each sprint.  Its clear that the functional team have plenty of ideas but these are not well communicated to the development team and the demo poses more questions than answers.   Have you any recommendations for improving the the quality of input from the functional people?  Further info: I think part of the problem is that there are no specs or  User Stories as such.

Is there any workaround to override these requirements?  So instead of:  'guzzlehttp/guzzle': '~5.0.0'   I'd like to set:  'guzzlehttp/guzzle': '^5.3'   ideally by changing only my local composer.json file.

For example, a user story like:     As a doctor I want to add patient information in order to create a new patient file.

47241856	Symfony route length restriction	Does a route length requirement exist? For example: I found this on Stacko.:  /**  * @Route('/{shortUrl}', requirements={„shortUrl' : '[a-zA-Z0-9]{8}'})  * @method({'GET'})  */   I hoped that the {8} restricts it to only be called when the 'shortUrl' is exactly 8 chars long but that does not work.   For your understanding:  I built a URL-shortener and now I'm facing this issue: The route above gets called when the user enters the URL-alias my site created for him and redirects him, this works as expected. This alias is formed from lower and upper case letters and digits (randomly).  But when he wants to view his profile (localhost/profile) the route above is called instead of the profile route, although the 'profile' part is only 7 chars long.

Or is there some other viable alternative to managing requirements other than Confluence that would integrate with TFS? To my knowledge, TFS Work Items aren't really a good fit for requirements documentation (other than short scenarios).  Thanks in advance. 	
456349	Why do so many sites discuss programming as opposed to describing the systems that they&#39;re trying to produce?	There are a lot of sites out there that teach people how to build better software, but why is it that there are very few sites that actually give detailed descriptions of the domains that we (as programmers) are supposed to create? One can only construct so many inventory, accounting, and ERP systems before a pattern of common requirements start to emerge among the different types of systems. Logically speaking, if programmers spend so much time trying to create reusable components in their architectures, does that imply that they should have to have some reusable 'blueprint' that describes the systems that they're supposed to create? In other words, it seems like the focus of software development has been too focused on 'how' software should be built rather than to catalogue and accurately specify (with detailed requirements) 'what' should be used in the first place.  So my question is this: Has there been any work done to catalogue all the different types of system specifications into a single place, all on a single site? If lacking the proper requirements at the start of the project is one of the banes of software development, wouldn't it make more sense to be able to 'reuse' requirement specifications from previous systems of the same type that have already been written?

24786769	Real world example where event capturing is necessary / preferred?	The addEventListener DOM method supports a third optional, boolean parameter (useCapture) to indicate whether the function should use event bubbling or event capturing as propagation method. In this article the difference is nicely shown (click on the examples &amp; view code).  From other questions on SO and blog posts, I concluded event bubbling was preferred mostly because IE8- didn't support it.   Suppose I'm only required to support IE9+, in what situation would event capturing be necessary or preferred over event bubbling? In other words, in what situation would it be better to let the events execute on the outermost elements first, and then the innermost elements? I'm looking for a simple, real world example to demonstrate the use of event capturing... 	
1893482	AMN and math logic notation	I'm not sure this is appropriate for stackoverflow, but I don't know where else to ask. I'm studying the B-Method for proving consistence in requirement specifications, and I have an issue with the logic math notation when specifying the pre conditions of the operations.  Simplifying the original problem, I have a variable which is a subset flights of the cartesian product between  FLIGHT_NO x TIME x TIME, where for each member (no,td,ta), no means the number of the flight, td the time of departure and ta the tme of arrival. How can I get, using math logic notation, the element of  flights that has the biggest value of td? 	
44344719	Is it possible to certify an AI-based solution for safety-critical systems?	First, I read this. But I would like to expand. To summarize:   When designing safety-critical systems a designer has to evaluate some metrics to get the confidence that the system will work as expected. It is, kind of, a mathematical proof with low enough complexity to be accessible to a human being. It has to do with accountability, reliability, auditability, etc... On the other hand, at this point, AI is a black box that seems to work very well, but most of the times we do not have a proof of its correctness (mainly because the thing going on in the box is too complex to be analyzed), it is more like a statistical certainty:  We trained the system and the system performed well for all the tests.   So, some questions?  Q1. Do these two vague thoughts make sense nowadays?  Q2. Is possible to use AI for safety-critical system and be sure of its performance? Can we have certainty about the deterministic behavior of AI? Any reference?  Q3. I guess there are already some companies selling safety-critical systems based on AI in the automotive realm for example. How do they manage to certify their products for such a restrictive market?  EDIT  About Q1: thanks to Peter, I realized that, for example, for the automotive example, there are not requirements about total certainty. ASIL D level, the most restrictive level for automotive systems, requires only an upper bound for the probability of failure. So do other ISO26262 standards and levels. I would refine the question:  Q1. Is there any safety standard in system design, at any level/subcomponent, in any field/domain, that requires total certainty?  About Q2: Even though total certainty were not required, the question still holds. In particular, I am reading now about possible attacks against AI: I will post the links here (at this moment I can not access them).  About Q3: Now I understand how they would be able to achieve certification. Anyhow, any reference would be very welcome. 	
44517119	Silverstripe - Requirements on another controller	I have built an image gallery module using lightboxes and effects. What I want to do is include the css and js requirements on the GalleryController rather than the PageController but it doesn't seem to work.  I have a Gallery which extends DataExtension and then I have a GalleryController which extends Extension. Then in my _config file I point the ContentController to my GalleryController:  SiteTree::add_extension('Gallery'); Object::add_extension('ContentController', 'GalleryController');   The GalleryController is working as it is getting the Gallery objects for me. It is the requirements on this controller that aren't working.  GalleryController:  public function init() {     parent::init();       //Load CSS requirements     Requirements::css('ImageGallery/css/lightgallery.min.css');      //Load Javascript requirements     Requirements::javascript('ImageGallery/js/lightgallery.min.js');   Do I need to do something else to include requirements on another controller that isn't PageController? 	
409252	Why do safety requirements like to discourage use of AI?	Seems that requirements on safety do not seem to like systems that use AI for safety-related requirements (particularly where large potential risks of destruction/death are involved). Can anyone suggest why? I always thought that, provided you program your logic properly, the more intelligence you put in an algorithm, the more likely this algorithm is capable of preventing a dangerous situation. Are things different in practice? 	
32920382	Which format is better for list in JSON API design, flat array or nested object?	For list API, such as Users, I find that there are two common formats.

44106222	How to choose a design pattern when your customer&#39; requirements are still a bit hazy	I have a flat file containing person 'Records' which I get from a service provider. Each Record is in fact a list of Records.  Each line in the file represents a Record with a given Type.  A person Record always contains the types '001' and '099', representing a start- and an end Record fora person. Other records are added to a person entry based on an 'incident'. Hence a Record is built based on the given incident.  Example.  000 # Start of doc. 001 # Person begin. ... n Records (n &gt; 001 &amp;&amp; n &lt; 099) ... 099 # Person end. 001 # Person begin. ... n Records (n &gt; 001 &amp;&amp; n &lt; 099) ... 099 # Person end. 001 # Person begin. ... n Records (n &gt; 001 &amp;&amp; n &lt; 099) ... 099 # Person end. 999 # End of doc.   Apart from the Record Type on each line there are other data contained within fixed positions.   Example of actual start Record  0010308952872          01000000000000 K1995-03-01   My approach, so far, is to define an .XSD per type of record and use schema binding classes. My problem is that there are still no requirements in regards to what types of records are relevant based on the type of incident. I would just grab a phone and call the person responsible, but working for the public sector makes planning a b****.  Does anyone have any suggestions to which software pattern could adhere most to this type of problem statement? Any sharing of experience would be much appreciated :} 	
43987766	What is the best way to determine WinAPI minimum supported client for a program?	I'm using Visual C++ and Windows API.

23895969	Manage TFS &quot;Affected by&quot; Links for many Work Items	I love being able to manage Parent-Child TFS Links in Excel with the 'Open Query in Microsoft Exel' button in Visual Studio.  I can create a Parent-Child relationship between two work items in Excel by cutting the child row, pasting it under the parent row and then indenting the child row.  When I hit the Publish button in Excel, all the Links are created in TFS between the modified Work Items.  Now I want to try this with other Link types, specifically Affects-Affected By.  The problem is that in TFS, the Parent-Child Links are the only hierarchical links available, so those are the only Links that work with the Indent-Outdent buttons in Excel.  I have a TON of Requirements that need to be mapped to Features with the Affects-Affected By Links and I really do not want to open each Work Item in TFS, go to the All Links tab, create a new Link, forget the ID, cancel out of the dialog, look up the ID again, go back to Work Item, create the Link, click OK, save the Work Item and then repeat this 3000 to 4000 more times.  I looked at Telerik's free tool 'TFS Work Item Manager' (http://www.telerik.com/teampulse/tfs) because I thought the Task Board screen might offer drag-and-drop Work Item association capability but I couldn't find anything that helped.  Is there a way to associate Work Items of different types (in my case Requirements and Features) with Affects or Affected By Links in a nicer UI like Excel or Telerik's tool that is more accommodating?

43737602	How to model Requirements Using SPES and Harmony Method?	I am working on finding Requirement Modelling Methods. There are a lot of methods like SPES, Harmony, INCOSE OOSEM, JPL State Analysis etc.  I have gathered details regarding SPES Method but I want to compare this method with Harmony Method.  In SPES Method we have different Viewpoints like Requirement Viewpoint, Functional Viewpoint, Logical Viewpoint and Technical Viewpoint.  To model our Requirements we use Requirement View point and there are few model according to different artifacts. Models contains specific SysML / UML diagrams to explain the artifacts.    Context model. Goal model. Scenario model. Structural Model (Data structures -SysMLBlock Diagram) Operational Model (SysML Activities Diagram) Behavioral Requirements Model Requirements Formalization   I know something about Harmony Method but vague description.  Like we use Usecase diagrams for Requirement Modelling then we use activity Diagrams for description of relationship between requirements and then we use Sequence diagrams.  Can someone explain me about Harmony method? Which type of Model diagrams we use in Harmony Method?  How we model our requirements in Harmony Method?  Which Method is more useful SPES or Harmony and why?  Actually I will use the data based on this comparison to model our Requirements in IBM Rational Rhapsody tool.

836211	Where to find good test case templates/examples?	I'm trying to establish more formal requirements and testing procedures then we have now, but I can't find any good reference examples of documents involved.  At the moment, after feature freeze testers 'click through the application' before deployment, however there are no formal specification what needs to be tested.  First, I'm thinking about a document which specifies every feature that needs to be tested, something like this (making this up):   user registration form   country dropdown (are countries fetched from the server correctly?) password validation (are all password rules observed, is user notified if password is too weak?)  thank-you-for-registration   ...and so on. This could also serve as something client can sign as a part of requirements before programmers start coding. After the feature list is complete, I'm thinking about making this list a first column in a spreadsheet which also says when was the feature last tested, did it work, and if it didn't work how did it break. This would give me a document testers could fill after each testing cycle, so that programmers have to-do list, with information what doesn't work and when did it break.  Secondly, I'm thinking of test cases for testers, with detailed steps like:   Load user registration form. (Feature 1.1) Check country dropdown menu.   Is country dropdown populated with countries? Are names of countries localized? Is the sort order correct for each language?  (Feature 1.2) Enter this passwords: 'a', 'bob', 'password', 'password123', 'password123#'. Only the last password should be accepted. Press 'OK'. (Feature 2) Check thank-you note.   Is the text localized to every supported language?    This would give testers specific cases and checklist what to pay attention to, with pointers to the features in the first document. This would also give me something to start automating testing process (currently we don't have much testing automation apart from unit tests).  I'm looking for some examples how others have done this, without too much paperwork. Typically, tester should be able to go through all tests in an hour or two. I'm looking for a simple way to make client agree on which features should we implement for the next version, and for testers to verify that all new features are implemented and all existing features are working, and report it to programmers.  This is mostly internal testing material, which should be a couple of Word/Excel documents. I'm trying to keep one testing/bugfixing cycle under two days. I'm tracking programming time, implementation of new features and customer tickets in other ways (JIRA), this would basically be testing documentation. This is lifecycle I had in mind:   PM makes list of features. Customer signs it. (Document 1 is created.) Test cases are created. (Document 2.) Programmers implement features. Testers test features according to test cases. (And report bugs through Document 1.) Programmers fix bugs. GOTO 4 until all bugs are fixed. End of internal testing; product is shown to customer.   Does anyone have pointers to where some sample documents with test cases can be found? Also, all tips regarding the process I outlined above are welcome. :)

28509965	Setuptools &quot;development&quot; Requirements	TL;DR: Is there a way to hook setuptool's 'develop' to install a set of development requirements when running python setup.py develop?   I'm building my first python package using setuptools. I'm specifying the requirements as:  requirements = [     'click',     'ansible',     'fabric',     'gitpython',     'pyyaml',     'jinja2',     'yapsy' ]  test_requirements = [     'pytest',     'pytest-pep8',     'pytest-cov', ]  setup( ...     install_requires=requirements,     tests_require=test_requirements, ... )   During development, I've been installing the package (in a virtual environment) with:  python setup.py develop   and uninstalling with:  python setup.py develop -u   The package uses entry_points to install some command line scripts, so this sets up the commands for me and allows me to edit the package while testing the command at the same time.  I also have some dependencies that I use for development ... sphinx + extensions and a couple other things (things that aren't needed to use the package). I'm just manually installing them in the virtual environment at the moment. I didn't see any documentation (and haven't found any examples on the googles) about how to wire them in with setuptools.  Maybe there's a way to hook 'setup.py develop' to install an additional set of requirements? Another method I haven't read about?

41759165	Good (standardized) methodology to specify binary telegrams/protocols	I'm looking for a technical specification methodology to specify binary data. I'm looking for something like an XML Schema Description (XSD) is for XML.  The aim is to use the format to generate programs that can interprete binary sequences correctly; i.e. a programming language binding. This would be just like there are many frameworks for XSD which can generate Classes in OO-Programming language that can represent XML-Data, parse and serialize. Still, the methodology needs to be highly human-readable such that domain experts can specify and interprete this textual specification.  So far I only found human-readable syntaxes. In many standards ASCII-Art is used, like in RFCs or AMQP like this:  0                   1                   2                   3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |          Source Port          |       Destination Port        | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |                        Sequence Number                        | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |                    Acknowledgment Number                      | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |  Data |           |U|A|P|R|S|F|                               | | Offset| Reserved  |R|C|S|S|Y|I|            Window             | |       |           |G|K|H|T|N|N|                               | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |           Checksum            |         Urgent Pointer        | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |                    Options                    |    Padding    | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |                             data                              | +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                         TCP Header Format   However, this is hardly machine readable.

41451283	INCLUDE statement in the alternate flow of a business use case	I'm doing a requirements analysis for a system and currently I try to write the business use cases (BUC) and make business use case diagram. I currently use the following guidelines:   When I have optional extra steps for a BUC I use an EXTEND-statement to point to the BUC where these optional steps can be found. Both the BUC that extends and the one that is extended can exist on it's own. When I have duplicate functionality in multiple BUC's I try to extract the this and put it in a separate BUC. Then I use an INCLUDE-statement in the BUC where I extracted the functionality, to point to the BUC where this functionality can be found. The BUC in which you point to the external BUC with the INCLUDE-statement cannot work on it's own.   This all worked fine for until I arrived at the following situation:   In the alternate flow of a BUC (let's call this one A) there's duplicate functionality that I already have specified in another BUC (let's call this one B). So naturally I want to use the INCLUDE-statement to point to B. If I do this I also have to show this in my business use case diagram. If I draw an INCLUDE arrow in the diagram (from A to B) it looks like A cannot exist without B. However this is not the case, as A only needs B when it's in the alternate flow.   I considered following options:   I keep all the functionality in the the alternate flow, but this makes the alternate flow too long and creates duplicate functionality. I use extend instead, but this imposes that B is optional while if you are in the alternate flow of A, you have to go through B.   Any thoughts? 	TRUE

40440496	Passing a JSON string to HTTP GET method using libcurl	I want to pass a JSON string via the HTTP GET method. Server side requires a JSON as follows:  const char* json[]= {\'revisions\':[{\'revision\':\'01\'},{\'revision\':\'02\'},{\'revision\':\'03\'},{\'revision\':\'04\'}]}   So I intend to pass such JSON like this, but I'm not sure whether I should convert it to a query string format or not, like this:  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, 'http://example.com?{\'revisions\'[{\'revision\':\'01\'},{\'revision\':\'02\'},{\'revision\':\'03\'},{\'revision\':\'04\'}]}');   I know I should use POST in this case. However, the requirement from server side requires using GET. Any help would be appreciated. 	FALSE
40434632	How to define effective use case?	I'm trying to define use cases for my project. The problem is I'm not sure how to effectively define a use case, and it looks very messy.  For example like my use case below. I feel like 'View profile', 'View Club' 'View Workshop' is necessary to include because of 'common sense' for user to click on certain profile to view it. So do I really need to define such use cases?  Car Club Use Case 	TRUE
39982045	How does node.js know express.js location	How does my node.js server know how to find the express.js file?  In my server.js file I have a requirement for express:  var express        = require('express'); var app            = express();   My server.js file is in the app folder while express.js is in the app\node_modules\express\lib folder:    express.js is here in the lib directory    Does node.js automatically know to look in node_modules for dependencies? There is no direct enumeration of the path anywhere - I don't see it in the code.   This is a sample project from scotch.io and I'm trying to pick it apart and learn. I'm pretty new to the MEAN stack and I'm trying to understand this at a basic level.  FYI this is node v 4.5.0 	
19176730	Are there exceptions to the rule that requirements should be atomic?	I'm reviewing a requirements spec where some of the requirements include the word 'and' or sometimes even a list of required functionality.  Am mostly thinking these should be broken up but this does have the downside of making a long document even longer and even less readable - which in practice may mean its intended audience ends up skimming over it or only reading sections rather than absorbing the whole thing.  However, there are some requirements where it seems a bit silly to break them up. E.g: there are a lot of get/set operations, which always go together - it seems a bit overkill to always break them up into 'The user shall be able to get...', 'The user shall be able to set...' Other examples are enable/disable, validation lists, supported platforms/browsers etc.  Just wondering if anyone has had similar thoughts and whether it might sometimes be OK to break the rule of atomicity? 	TRUE
37909513	UML - Use case scenarios &amp; data dictionaries	I am currently working for a company writing use cases.  They have a template which mixes them with data dictionaries.  I've never seen this kind of template. I searched the web looking for answers. I am wondering if this is a correct practice/method. If it is, does this template have an specific name? They are calling it use case template, I do think is wrong to call it that way.  This is an example:  Note: This template has a valid use case written above of it (not shown in here).  Step:  1  Actor: Application  Action:  Display login page  Login page section has the following fields: - Username - Password - Submit button  Here's the description of the fields for this section: - Username - textbox field, required, no default value, allow 10 character maximum - Password - textbox field, required, no default value, allow alphanumeric characters, allow a maximum of 30 characters    Step:  2  Actor: User  Action: User enters username &amp; password User hits submit button   Step:  3  Actor:  Application  Action:  The app allows access to the page.

40077592	Symfony routing stopped working when not in requirements list	When I first set the project up (in 3.1.4), I set up for the default route a list of default values for the variable to be sent in (locationId) and another route to catch anything that was not in the list and route it to a default value. This stopped working when I tested it again recently, so I set up a new default symfony project and just modified the DefaultController to (this is in 3.1.5):  &lt;?php  namespace AppBundle\Controller;  use Sensio\Bundle\FrameworkExtraBundle\Configuration\Route; use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\Controller; use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request; use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;  class DefaultController extends Controller {     /**      * @Route('/{locationId}', name='homepage', requirements={'locationId': 'L|CH|GCB'})      */     public function indexAction($locationId = 'L')     {         echo $locationId;          return new response('&lt;br&gt;blah');     }      /*      * NOTE: This route is just used for any values that are not matched so they go to L      * @Route('/{locationId}')      */     public function nocampAction($locationId)     {         return $this-&gt;indexAction();     } }   This SHOULD mean that if /path/to/app_dev.php/L is called, it would then echo L and blah. If L is replaced with CH or GCB it should echo them. However, if a value is sent through that is none of these it should default to L. But when I try /path/toapp_dev.php/LLL I get the route can't be found message!  Any idea why this is happening? It never triggers the second route.  NOTE: This test DOES work (old project I cut the code out of so 3.1.4):  &lt;?php  namespace AppBundle\Controller;  use Sensio\Bundle\FrameworkExtraBundle\Configuration\Route; use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\Controller; use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request; use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;  class DefaultController extends Controller {     /**      * @Route('/{varname}', name='homepage', requirements={'varname': '1|2|3'})      */     public function indexAction($varname = 'Cool')     {         echo $varname;         return new Response('&lt;br&gt;default');     }      /**      * NOTE: blah      * @Route('/{varname}')      */     public function novarAction()     {         return $this-&gt;indexAction();     }      /**      * @Route('/test/{varname}')      */     public function testAction()     {         echo 'testAction';         return new Response('OK');     } }

708939	UI Driven Development	Does the idea of UI Driven Development make sense at all? Most of our clients like to convey their requirements in form of screens. For e.g. I want a screen to do THIS and THAT. Sometimes they even go as far as to dictate the layout of a screen by themselves (this may be because clients of today use software applications for most of their tasks already).  Also this method of requirement gathering seems to convey both the Data and Associated Behavior automatically.  What do you guys think? 	TRUE
39102364	How to properly model system requirements in UML (Sparx Enterprise Architect)	I have a list of system requirements that I have imported from IBM Rational DOORS, and I am curious as to what would be a good way to model their relationships with each other in a diagram. Which Structural diagram should I use, or should it be one of the Behavioral ones?    What I've currently created are links to the requirements in an Object diagram, but I would like to make these Child diagrams that I can link to Class diagrams as well. Does this mean that in order to not create a unique diagram for every class element it's linked to, it should be a composite diagrams the requirements are linked to? 	TRUE
38937648	What power supply for servo?	This might be a stupid question although I tried to search everywhere and the answer is kinda of fuzzy. I am trying to power a MG996R High Torque Metal Gear Dual Ball Bearing Servo (manual and description below). This is attached to an arm (wooden) that should with right friction spin a dish (Monitor holder). This is all powered by the arduino. The problem is that the specific voltage as in the manual says is 6v(current 500mA to 900 mA) but the operating voltage is 4.2V a 7.2V exactly how written and it's confusing.  I am planning on hooking it up to a Arduino UNO R3 ATmega 328. I though about buying a hook up of 4 AA batteries 1.5V and make up to 6V to power the servo but I don't know if it will be powering it for much. The other option is to buy a 7.2V power supply or a LiPo to power it but so confusing. Here is a link to the manual from the manufacturer:  Manual  Thank you all!

37809079	Implementation and change request tab in requirement work item	In TFS 2010 a requirement work item had also an implementation and a change request tab.    In TFS 2012 the requirement work item also had an implementation and change request tab as written in the documentation, but the picture of a newly created requirement doesn't show anymore these tabs.  Now, in TFS 2015 those two tabse aren't mentioned any more, though the CMMI process shows the work item hierachy as  Epic > Feature > Requirement > Task  I am missing the implementation and change request tab in the standard configuration the CMMI project, because they are very useful in tracking the whole work from defining the features down to the requirements and their implementation with testing as well as subsequent change requests.  Are there any ways to get back these tabs in the standard configuration? I don't like to change the predefined work item types, because you never now what happens with next upgrades of TFS. 	
2225360	Requirements management plugin for Trac?	Are there any requirements management plugins out there for Trac? I checked the list on Trac-Hacks and didn't see anything   I'm picturing some functionality like IBM's DOORS system. Basic features include revisioning and change control of requirements, requirements baselining etc.  Update: I suppose I could just use the wiki portion of Trac to document requirements, but this doesn't allow anykind of change sets for the requirements - for example where a single requirement has changed but developers are working against a baseline where the requirement hasn't been updated yet. It also won't allow linking requirements such that when a parent requirement changes, all dependent requirements must be reviewed before the change is accepted (in order to keep dependent requirements in sync). 	TRUE
37287780	What would be a minimum system/browsers version to run a simple website?	I got this job which I have to create a promotional website for a prefecture and they are asking me to list the minimum system requirements a user must fulfill to access this website. I am not sure on how to make this list. The website will have two versions: one very simple for older browsers and computers, and another one responsive. The idea is to maintain everything very simple, without any animation or something that would be difficult to run on older browsers.  What do you guys think would be a safe way to describe the minimum system/browsers version for using a website like this?  Thank you very much!

Also IMHO, programmers would prefer to implement from an unambiguous text representation of the requirements,  rather than from sprawling multi page diagrams.  	TRUE
36618037	Openstack - hardware requirements	I've been needing a new VM host for some time now, and from working with/on AWS at work, 'The Cloud' seems to be a good idea.  I've done some math, and no matter how I count, it's going to be cheaper to do it myself, than colo or something else. Plus, I really like lots of blinking lights :D  A year or so, I heard about Openstack and have been looking cursory at it since then. Seems big and complex (and scary!), and some friends who have been trying to do it at work for a year and still not quite finished/succeeded, indicate that it is what it seems :)  However, I like tormenting myself, so I've decided I'm going to give it a try. It does provide all the functionality, and then some, that I need. Theoretically, I could go with Vagrant, but that's not quite half-way to what I want/need.  So, I've been looking at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStack#Components and from that came to the following conclusion:  Required: (Nova, Glance, Horizon, Cinder)  This seems to be the 'core' services. I need all of them.   Nova Compute fabric controller Glance Image service (for templates) Horizon Dashboard Cinder Block storage devices (can work with ZoL w/ 3rd party driver)   Less important: (Barbican, Trove, Designate)  I really don't need any of this, it's more of 'could be nice to have at some point'.   Barbican REST API designed for the secure storage, provisioning and management of secrets Trove Database-as-a-service provisioning relational and non-relational database engine Designate DNS as a Service   Possibly not needed: (Neutron, Keystone)  These ones I don't know if I need. I have DHCP, VLAN, VPN, DNS, LDAP, Kerberos services on the network that work just fine, and I'm not replacing them!   Neutron (previously Quantum) Network management (DHCP, VLAN) Keystone Identity service (can work with existing LDAP servers)   Not needed: (Swift, Ceilometer, Ironic, Zaqar, Searchlight, Sahara, Heat, Manilla)  Meh! I'm doing this for me, for my basement and for my own development and enjoyment, so don't need that. Would be nice to go with a fully object based storage, but that's not feasible for me at this time.   Swift Object storage system Ceilometer Telemetry Service (billing) Ironic Bare metal provisoning instead of virtual machines Zaqar multi-tenant cloud messaging service for Web developers (~ SQS) Searchlight Advanced and consistent search capabilities across various OpenStack cloud services Sahara Easily and rapidly provision Hadoop (storing and managing vast amounts of data cheaply and efficient) clusters Heat Orchestration layer (store the requirements of a cloud application in a file that defines what resources are necessary for that application) Manila Shared File System Service (manage shares in a vendor agnostic framework)   If we don't count storage (I already have my own block storage, which I can use with Cinder and some 3rd party plugins/modules) and compute nodes (everything that's left over will become compute nodes), can I run all this on one machine? With a hot standby/failover?  Everything is going to be connected to the same power jack, same rack, same [outgoing] network cable so more redundancy that that is overkill. I don't even need that, but 'why not' :)  The basic recommendation I've heard is four to six machines. And after a lot of pestering the ones who said that, it turns out that 'two storage, two controller, two compute'. Which, is what I was thinking as well: Running this on two machines should be enough. They're basically only going to run Glance, Horizon and Cinder. And possibly Neutron and Keystone.  Neither of them seems to be very resource-heavy.  Is there something I'm missing?  Oh, and nothing of this is going to face the 'Net! It's all just for me. 	
7579244	Agile Requirements Up-front	I understand that it is better to discover requirements through iterative approaches in Agile, however I often hear of people rejecting projects on the basis that they are given up-front requirements.  Why is this the case? Why can't up-front requirements just be taken as-is, e.g. just added to a product backlog and then prioritized and implemented? 	TRUE
3924465	Where are some good resources for word templates for programming needs?	For example, I have a wide variety of needs for templates, like in creating project plans, project specifications, requirements etc.  But I have never created my own forms before, so it really helps to see other practical/actual examples.  Is there a good central resource for ms word templates for programmers/programming?  I have just started to read the book Code Complete by Steve McConnell, and I started seeing the need for templates to help doing better planning, specs, etc.  Even if there is no 1 site with tons of ms word templates/spreadsheets for programmers, makes me wish there was one, easy to use resource...  If you can point me to any links of template sites, that would be really helpful.

So the question - is there are some requirements for displaying video/image in 360 VR mode or it's just simple as 2 duplicated video for every aye?

To keep current filter criteria and refresh page after add product'   Those Requirements were collected by us. Those User stories were wrote by our outsourcing team .   Shall i consider this a Bug or a New User Story , or should i simply reopen the old user Story and edit it to account for the new request? What is the 'best-practice', what are pros and cons of each approach?  Thanks a lot!  From my understanding , business requirements are always simplicity,  user stories are always small and abstract.  Some times we can't realized the above issue until developer is starting coding and developer tell us.  it is function process and technical problem ,  it should be submitted to discussed by developer during development phase . so i think it is bug .

30891674	TFS work item type for requirements management targeting multiple platforms	In my company we are using TFS for projects targeting multiple platforms (Web, iOS, Android), and since we work on sensitive/regulated projects we have a lot of requirements to produce for each little detail of our softwares/algorithms.  The problems comes when we have requirements that are shared on multiple platforms (a common algorithm for example) and for that we found 2 solutions: either we duplicate the requirements for each platform, or we create additional columns on the requirement itself (like the state column which is duplicated for each platform for example..).  With the first solution it becomes hard to maintain requirements (mostly when you have thousands of entries..) and with the 2nd solution we get a really ugly template, that needs to change when a new platform is targeted and traceability with tests cases is not that good...  So I was wondering if there is a 'known/official' solution for theses cases. When I looked at the test case work item type, I noticed that there's the notion of 'test point' that represents the test case for a given 'test configuration', so maybe the solution is to create a new work item type that would represent the platform (and store the state on the given platform for example).  Anyway, I'm taking any advice/suggestion on that topic :)

30838875	output of one file input to next	How would the output of one script be passed as the input to another? For example if a.py outputs format.xml then how would a.py call b.py and pass it the argument format.xml? I think it's supposed to work like piping done on the command line.  I've been hired by a bunch of scientists with domain specific knowledge but sometimes there computer programming requirements don't make sense. There's a long chain of 'modules' and my boss is really adamant about 1 module being 1 python script, and the output of one module is the input of the next. I'm very new to Python, but if this design pattern rings a bell to anyone let me know.

30430484	Going from requirements to use cases and how to know if my document is good enough	I'm here again asking about software documentation. I read a lot about it but it is a bit harder to put in practice, first because of the lack of examples and second because most small companies just don't care at all.  So I have a set of requirements for functionalities for a iteration of a software that I and a friend is doing. see bellow:   The system shall enable users to login through a UI* where he enters a username* and password*. The system shall display an error message on a particular area of ​​the UI* If the user* enters a combination of wrong username and password. The system shall redirect the user to a welcome UI* after successfully logged in. The system shall allow each user to have an access level, forming a hierarchy where only users of higher levels can perform an action* on users* from lower levels. The system shall associate users* that have special permissions* for a custom group*. The system shall associate each user* with a group*. The system shall retain the permissions* per user if the user belongs to the custom group*. Otherwise the permissions* should be inherited from the group. The system shall enable password reset only generating an automatic password and sending to the user's* email. The system must store the following user information, login, group, password, name, email, mobile phone. The system should allow users to change their information. The system should enable administration of permissions* actions*, groups* and users* through a UI* where user's can add, delete, create and edit entries (eg. Add groups, delete users).   So should I challenge these requirements more? How can I test/challenge it effectively?  After that, how can I go from this set of requirements to use cases (assuming they are good enough) to Use case.   I know I need to start finding the actors. But the only actor I see is the 'user' and he will performing CRUD operations on users, actions, groups and permissions. But how should I detail these use cases, 'Manage users' for example? Or should I go for a deeper detail level? Like 'add user' 'create group', etc.  glossary *user: is the person who will use the system to manage it based on his privileges. *UI: user interface. *username: a set of characters with max length of 50 with alpha numeric chars. *password: a set of characters with max length of 50 with alpha numeric chars, must be encrypted. *group: a list of named groups that each user must be associated with. *actions: a list of actions a user can do on the system that must be associated with permissions. *permission: a list associating users and groups to a specific action.

When asking for more detail, one is informed that you are asking for too much detail and since this is agile, the requirement will become clearer later during the sprint (2 week sprint) and you should not worry about the detail just then, but rather to just give the story a weight in 'doll hairs' and stop being difficult.  Be a big picture guy.  Don't worry about the detail.  Is this what agile is supposed to be like? 	TRUE
301317	System Requirements for E-Commerce Application with SSL bigger than 40 bits	I need to define the system requirements hardware and software for building a E-Commerce Web application with SSL (more than 40 bits).

29378470	How to check for python script requirements on windows	I have been developing a python script for a few days now, and wanted to send the final result to a friend of mine. Is there a way to get all software requirements to run my program?  The python part is relatively easy, as I can just look at my import list on my script. The problem is external software requirements.  For example, one of the python modules I'm using is Rasterio. I could not install this through conda or pip, until I installed Visual Studios C++ Community Version. I imagine there is some specific dll file that is being used. I can't really tell though.  I would really like to make a standalone setup.bat file, that installs all requirements and finally allows the user to simply run my program. I'm not 100% sure right now of those requirements though.  How can I get these?

28871541	AGILE user stories for requirements gathering?	Would like to ask on how would you write user stories where your initial set of tasks is to analyze or gather requirements.  A little background, let's say a client has a legacy application where they would like to have it converted to an online app. The legacy app uses solely excel sheets + macros. Now, when writing user stories, how would your write the following?   Gathering of existing sample data, based on this, the existing physical excel files with correspoding documentation Analysis of the excel files and documentation to derive business rules and logic (what are the possible values of this excel field? etc, etc)  analysis regarding relationship of data, normzalition forms, etc    Can I do something like - As a business analyst, i would like to yaddi-yadda?  it doesnt sound right...  Can you guys help me by stating a few examples of agile user stories for requirements gathering? Thank you. 	TRUE

28530127	Can a single use case be partially implemented, or implemented over several phases? How to track &amp; prioritize components?	My requirements experience has been primarily with user stories, not use cases. I've been recently added to a project as a product owner, and the customer is ~80% done with the use cases. Many of the use cases include what would be over a dozen user stories, and the team is discussing how to implement some of the use cases over multiple phases, or how to partially implement to meet schedule. This wouldn't be a problem with stories, but I'm not sure the best way to approach with use cases.  Can a use case ever be partially implemented? Or would that mean that it should be decomposed into smaller use cases with extends/includes? If it can be partially implemented, how do you track individual features so high-priority items do not get lost?  For example, if I have a single use case for a spell checker with the following:   Identifying potentially mis-spelt words Visually identifying misspelt words as the user types Autocorrecting commonly misspelt words as the user types Providing user with a list of suggested spellings for individual words Providing the user the ability to mass-correct misspellings Allowing the user to ignore potential misspellings once Allowing the user to add words to the dictionary   How would I go about prioritizing the individual features and then tracking implementation of features 1 and 4 in one phase, 2, 3, 6 in second, 5 in a third, and not implementing 7? In this example, should these be separate use cases, or one with multiple alternative flows? 	TRUE
24995066	How to install JDK 8 on Mac OS X Snow Leopard?	According to the system requirements, even Java 7 requires Lion, but then I found this question: How to install java jdk 7 on Snow Leopard. Especially the answer stating that java 7 doesn't, in fact, require 10.7 and that this restriction can just be removed from the .pkg gives hope that it is possible to install even Java 8 on Snow Leopard. Any information on this? 	
18850892	Is there such a thing as a &quot;Non-Functional Use Case&quot;?	I'm reading a System Requirements Document that was produced using Sparx Enterprise Architect. All requirements are mapped to particular Use Cases.  A few of the non-functional requirements for 'high availability' are mapped to a Use Case called 'Provide High Availability', marked as &lt;&lt;non-functional&gt;&gt;. Am fairly new to all this and struggling to decide if it makes sense for a Use Case be non-functional - hence the question.  If the answer is yes then great - but if not, I'd be interested to know people's opinions on how such requirements should map to Use Cases (if at all). 	TRUE

27616525	Are these requirements correct (variable relations)	There is this example in a book, reading:     The   system shall allow posting of envelopes where the longest side (l) is   longer than or equal to 12 centimeters, but not longer than 75   centimeters. The smallest side (w) must be longer than or equal to 1   centimeter. The length must be twice the width and must be greater   than or equal to 10 centimeters. Measures are always rounded up to the   nearest centimeter. We can rewrite this requirement to read:    length >= 12 length &lt; 75 width >= 1 length – 2 x width >= 10   I do not understand how the last requirement (...l>=10) can coexist with the first requirement (l>=12)  Am I missing something here? 	TRUE
2514881	Establishing project requirements - anyone had any eureka moments?	I repeatedly find that establishing user requirements is one of the hardest parts of my job. This is for several reasons, for example, lack of shared technical vocabulary, incomplete understanding of domain on my part, inability of user to 'imagine' completed UI / product, etc etc.  Since this appears to be an ongoing challenge for me, has anyone here had a 'eureka' moment that has really helped them with this part of developing? For example, I have heard of the book 'Domain Driven Design', but not read it yet. Has anyone found a book, online resource of piece of advice that has really turned things around for them? 	TRUE
27539161	Why do some websites/applications require that passwords must begin with a letter?	Some number of websites/applications require that a password must begin with a letter, I find this plain stupid. It's pretty annoying... and the password entropy (security) is greatly reduced. So my question is... Is there a reason why some developers would choose this?   The only reasons I could think of are:   They are sheep (Seen it required somewhere else and just copied the trend) Some just implement it because that's the little regex they know Just to create a false sense of security for their clients   (Asking because I'm developing an app to manage user passwords and thinking to alert the users that if the website asks for that, they should not trust their security) 	
27358301	Hoster requirements for running Solr	I am planning to add a full-text search engine for searching a MySQL database to a website. Most recommendations on a nice, user-friendly implementation I found, mentioned the use of Apache Solr.  Keeping this in mind I started searching for the requirements for a hoster to use Solr but I didn't find any useful information expect for 'it should support java'. So I picked a random host that states it has Java JRE installed (http://wiki.dreamhost.com/What_We_Support) and asked if they supported Solr. Unfortunately, the answer was 'no'.  So, what would I need to be looking for? Do I need a dedicated server, a VPN, or are there shared hosting solutions where it is possible to run Solr?  What are the system requirements?  I hope there is someone out there, who knows a bit about this. Thanks! 	
23886880	Get a list of all requirements from Composer	We use composer to install 3rd party libraries. Dependencies can have their own requirements (other libraries, but also enabled extensions).

Like a list of extensions that need to be enabled for the given project. 	
1061784	How can I learn about writing project specs?	I recently read through Code Complete, and it recommends that I create a project specification before actually coding.  The book didn't go very far into detail about what 'specs' are, and how they are made. Because this is a crucial part of software development, I would like to know how to create quality specs that are not too exhaustive.  Where can I learn more about software specifications? Or any of the other prerequisites outlined in Code Complete? 	TRUE
2719451	Software Requirement Specifications for Web Applications	I'm looking for some guidance/books to read when it comes to creating a software requirement specification for a web application. For inspiration I have read some spec documents for desktop based applications. The documents I have read capture a systems functional requirements in use cases which tend to be rather data oriented with use cases centered around the various CRUD operations the application is intended to perform.  I like this structure however I'm finding it rather difficult to marry it to what my web application needs to do, mostly reading data as opposed to manipulating it. I've had a go at writing some use cases however they all tend to boil down to 'Search for item', 'Change view of search results' or 'User selects facet to refine search results'. This doesn't sound quite right to me and makes me wonder if I'm going about this the right way.  Are there planning differences between web based and desktop based applications?  	TRUE

20219903	getting the balance right between SBEs and other product documentation	Reading online material (e.g. Fowler, Gerard), it seems that Specification By Example stories should not be complete specifications of functionality.  Question 1: How does one starting off with SBE's decide how comprehensive their stories need to be in terms of describing all of the functionality of a system?  I.e. when can I stop writing stories because I have captured enough?  Question 2: In an organisation where test teams verify products against the product documentation, if the stores are not a complete specification, am I correct in thinking that 'other' product documentation needs to contain all the cases that are not covered by the SBE's? 	
26471820	Simple Requirements Management	Looking for a vary simple way to manage requirements using text editor, the following is desird:   Can be easily edited by developers, readable in text Can be converted to PDF document for managers revisions can be tracked on git it can be broken up into chapters and sections Images can be added to requirement document. Paragraphs introducing the chapter can be added.   I tried LaTeX, its just not working, too many rules, too complex.  So each Requirement has 6 fields.   Requirement Number (1 to 4 digit integer) Depends on (Line above) Requirement Name Class (4 to 10 chars) Priority (required or optional) Requirement string   So I have tried to do the following which works ok in markdown  Req  | Belongs |    Name         | Class | Priority -----|---------|-----------------|-------|--------- 1209 | 1208    | File Delimiters | sysrs | required  Each file is enclosed in curly braces ``{}''. ____   But i do not like to always having to adjust the spacing in 'name field' when the name length changes.  So I tried the following:  --- ** 1209 ** &gt;&gt;&gt; 1208, File Delimiters, sysrs, required  Each file is enclosed in curly braces ``{}''. ___   But it is little hard to read.  So I would love to make it like this:  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | 1209 | File Delimiters | 1208 | sysrs | required -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Each file is enclosed in curly braces ``{}''. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   but markdown turns both of the lines into titles.  Would anyone have any recommendations?  Would like to avoid writing scripts to change the format.  Thanks... 	
14392050	What defines a real-time/near-real time system?	Is there a specific metric which a system should meet to be considered/classified as real-time web application or a near- real time web application?  When I see a non-functional requirement for a system on which I am working which states the solution shall return data in real time/near real time.  I understand the definition of the terms (as found http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_real-time), but I was wondering if there were standards like one might find for an application UI (example: Gnome recommendations http://developer.gnome.org/hig-book/3.5/feedback-response-times.html.en) for expectations of near real time in a web application.  This is a variant of another question: Define realtime on the web for business 	
26431533	How to import legacy requirement IDs into TFS 2013?	I am trying to import some existing requirements into TFS 2013 (currently just maintained in a Word doc). However, I need to preserve the existing, pre-assigned requirement IDs (for tracking against existing test cases outside of TFS, etc.). I've come up with multiple ways of doing it:   Keep it as part of the requirement title Add it to the description for the requirement Add a tag with the legacy req id to the appropriate req in TFS Add a new field for it to the requirement template (or simply use an existing unused field)   All of these seem pretty unclean to me except the 'new field' option, but I'd rather avoid changing the work item template if I could.  Are there are other/better ways to do this? Has anybody done something similar before? 	
7433499	Definitions for CMMI Requirement Types in TFS2010	I've recently been informed that I need to define the requirements for the project I'm working on using TFS and CMMI. Upon writing a new requirement, you must supply a 'Requirement Type'. My question is, where can I find actual definitions of the different requirement types? Yes, of course I have googled this already and have found some glossaries that are closely aligned, but not perfect.  If any of you out there have experience with CMMI, and can define these types or point to a better source of information, I would be greatly thankful.  To make this easier, the CMMI requirement types are listed (in TFS) as:   Business Objective Feature Functional Interface Operational Quality of Service Safety Scenario Security  	TRUE
849840	Using a Wiki for Requirements Management?	I have been looking for a collaborative tool for developing functional specifications. I am looking for the ability to:    Have multiple users contribute to the specification. Provide some form of traceability, which could be done manually if needed.  Provide users with the ability to add comments and notes.    Upload and display Visio documents  Upload and display mockup screens using Balsamiq Mockup.   My initial impression is that using a wiki could be a good tool for this task. Does anyone have experience with using a wiki for creating functional specifications?  What would be the pros and cons to using a tool like this as opposed to a requirements management tool?  Your input is greatly appreciated!

21161666	How can be estimated maximum system usage?	We have web service connected to REST API a we need to estimate maximum usage for specifying HW requirements.   Inputs - We know estimated number of users and we know number of requests that we're able to process on one server instance per some time unit. Required output - number of server instances needed to process all requests, including unexpected peaks.  Problem we are facing - there can be usage peaks during hours and not all customers will make the same number of requests per some time unit etc.   How can be modeled such problem? Is there some technique or we can only estimate the final usage? 	
24307347	Software requirements analysis - Correctness of requirements	I'm just reading a book about Software Engeneering Design (book on amazon). I can not understand an example of correct and incorrect requirement, described in the book.  The book says:   the incorrect requirement is:     The software shall require users to log on using a unique combination of user ID and password.  the correct requirement is:     The software shall require users to log on using a user ID and password. The software shall require users to log on using a valide-mail address.    To illustrate the problem of requirements correctness, the book presents the example:     Example is based on requirements for a computer security system for which it requires users to log on using a unique combination of user ID and password.      In this case, when users attempt to log on using already existing user name or password, the system is required to reject the attempt, therefore giving insight into someone else's logon information.   How it is possible to give insight into user's logon information? What information can be obtained from the rejection of log on?  	TRUE

What does the exclamation point signify, that it's NOT an Array?  Why is there an equal sign at the end?  What is the period for?  Looking at another Stackoverflow question, the [requires] parameter is used to list other modules that this module uses.  So, is this sort of like an Include statement, that puts another module inside of this module? 	
4028786	MSF Agile: Risk vs Story Points?	I'm working through the creation of an initial set of user stories for a new project, and I'm using MSF Agile for the first time. I've got about 100 user stories, and I've assigned them all to areas and iterations, but the next step for me is assigning all of their Risk, Story Points, and Stack Rank values. However, I find that I'm assigning nearly mirror opposite values for risk and story points, i.e. all me 1-High risk stories are 3 story points, and all my 3-Low risk stories are 1 story points.   The MSDN documentation defines these fields as such:  'Story Points: A subjective unit of measure that captures the size of a user story. If you assign more points to a user story, you indicate that more work is required to implement it.'  'Risk: A subjective rating of the relative uncertainty around the successful completion of the user story. You can specify the following values: 1 - High, 2 - Medium, 3 - Low'  I find that these go hand in hard for pretty much every situation I've come across. In your experience, what are some examples of high risk stories worth only few story points, or low risk stories worth many points?   I need help in reasoning about these differently. How should I be thinking about these? 	TRUE
24531488	Cakephp 2.5.2 installation requirements	It may be unusual to ask for requirements as it's common to find this kind of information on the developers pages. But in this case I'm in doubt if there can be 'undefined' requirements.  Let's see what I've got.  I prepared a complete setup including the DebugKit as you can see on the first image.  Then, totally in accordance with the manuals, i prepared 2 tables, and 'baked all'.  The second image shows a screenshot of the output of the users/index.ctp on my local machine and on another server where everything runs normal.  But, after uploading this to the server where I expect to host the site I got lots of errors and undefined index messages. See the output on the third image.    I have to mention that the server works with PHP 5.3.28 and pdo_enabled and that I've copied all files to the /public_html folder so that there are no special rooting requirements.  So my questions: Are there other requirements to have cakephp 2.5.2 running? What can cause the malfunction?

I'd write my CSS as follows:  table {     width: 500px; }   That will apply across the board for all tables. Now, what if they change the requirement so that some tables are 600px. What's the best way to modify the CSS? Should I give the tables classes so  table.SizeOne {     width: 500px; }  table.SizeTwo {     width: 600px; }   Or is there a better way for me to deal with changes like this? 	
23805681	UML use case diagram server as system actor and which kind of use cases	I´m creating an use case diagram based on the following scenario:  There is a mobile application which passes data to an webserver/database. The webserver on the other hand sends data to the mobile application.   So i have two questions:   Data send to the application is individual data only for this smartphone/user. So does it make sense to show server/database as an external system actor which gets connected with the specific use cases? Are use cases (for the mobile app) like 'showing information about something' oder 'refresh data' necessary? Because i think they are not necessary for the business logic. What do you think?

4832029	Tool to track requirements and assumptions	I am leading a fairly massive project right now that is in it's idea phase (just getting off the ground) that has more questions than answers today.  With all of the uncertainty, our standard methodology for tracking requirements and gathering estimates won't cut it.  However, I still have to build a model and get the data that management needs for corporate accounting and budgeting purposes.    I've been asked to simply document the assumptions we're making as a project team and that the developers and application owners would be able to provide a very high level estimate for the work as needed by the business for budgeting purposes...  I need a tool that will also allow assumptions to be tied to high level requirements in a 1 to many relationship so that any changes to an assumption will allow us to identify where more estimation work is required.  Example...  Assumption: We will operate with a single facility responsible for x, y, and z.    Requirement/Scope:  - This system will need to have an additional facility added.  - This other system will need to be capable of processing x, y, and z.  So at the end of the day, if my assumption changes I want to quickly see that I have at least an impact to 2 of my requirements/scope lines... 	
3498070	Changing project requirements - should client pay	Not sure where to put this but a site filled with working programmers is a good bet.  I built a website for a client, that included (on the home page) a fancy jQuery image slider with controls. This was specified in the original project scope. I also implemented a simple jQuery slider on one of the inner pages.  Now that the site is up for final review, the client reviewed the site and wants a few edits here and there, one being the removal of the fancy jQuery I spent hours working on and modifying and replaced with the simpler slider on the inner pages.  My question:  Should the client still pay for home jQuery slider I worked on and charged to implement the other jQuery slider on the home page?  I charge per feature/functionality when building a site. Therefore, if I just remove the slider, I'll lose money and time. I'm thinking they should pay for it since it was specified in the original scope...not my fault...  Second question, how should I present them with the charge, if I am charging them for it? 	TRUE
3023501	How to define supported BlackBerry OS versions and models for application?	After company wins a project it is usual to mention in contract what devices are supported and what OS versions are supported.   But taking into account BlackBerry it appears sometimes to be tricky, as you can have the same device model, but two and(or) more different OS versions (or within same OS different package versions). And in this situation application may need to be updated.   So the main question here is what is expected to be mentioned in contract? Could you please share some your experience of resolving such problems?   So as a good example can be case of video playback issue on Storm:  some issue exists on 5.0.0.XXX (network provider A) and doesn't exist on 5.0.0.YYY (network provider B),  or could be following:  5.0.0.XXX1 (network provider A) - issue exist  5.0.0.XXX2 (network provider A) - issue doesn't exist   The point here is to define some boundaries of development company responsibility.

23052528	How to know if authentication is really a requirement	We have a small webapplication where users can mark spots on a map. We don't authenticate users, because we don't need to. Marked Spots aren't secret at all, everybody should see them and things should be very open and transparent to everybody. Because there is nothing to authorize we also don't need to authenticate. Nevertheless we keep something like a user profile in a cookie. A user can store default values for some fields in this 'wallet' cookie so that he only need to type it once.   That's our little anarchy app ;) ...but as said: It's simple and it's fast and the users like that.   But:   Basically there IS a need of some security, just to make sure the system isn't filled with nonsense from people who aren't interested in the intention of the app. So from my point of view that is a nonfunctional requirement (my point of view as an system architect) Also the (group of) users say that they want 'a login' for some reason, but actually they can't tell why   What I am trying to do now is to find out what they really want. I assume their requirement isn't 'authentication' but something they think that a login is needed for. So for our next couple of sprints I am trying to formulate some user stories to cover this requirements and to ask the users for their goals and benefits.  My question now is: Does it make sense to write a user story like this?     As users of system XY, we want user authentication by login, so that we can be sure that only serious input is generated.   In other words: How would you point out the need for authentication and how it should be done (to keep things simple and not to provide an obstacle for users)? Can 'authentication' be a goal in a requirement?  Some more considerations on this issue:   Users don't want to type passwords. They want some kind of SSO Some users told, that they want everybody to mark spots, but they don't want everybody to see them (so everyone is allowed to write, only some are allowed to read). That's a totally new goal in our app, but I still don't get the benefit yet. that also implies, that there are privileged users, and that there is a need for user management, administration UIs and groups and so on...  	TRUE

22490198	BDD and form fields	I've read Specification by Example and several BDD articles, which all say to avoid details like specific form fields in the feature description and scenarios.  But if the specification of which form fields we need and what validations are appropriate is not in the examples, where is it?  I am considering putting all the form fields in the scenarios, along with having a scenario for each validation.  It seems like a lot of overhead; is there a better way?  EDIT: For example, take the following.  Feature: Add new product  In order to sell a new product on our website As an internal user I want to add the product to our catalog  Scenario: Successful addition  Given I am logged in When I try to add a new product And I provide 'Widget' as the name And I provide 1 lb. as the weight And I provide 1 inch as the height And I provide 2 inches as the width And I provide 3 inches as the length Then I see the new product that was added  Scenario: Duplicate name  Given I am logged in And an existing product named 'Dupe' When I try to add a new product And I provide 'Dupe' as the name Then I see a duplicate name error  Scenario: Invalid Weight  Given I am logged in When I try to add a new product And I provide -1 as the weight Then I see an invalid weight error  Scenario: Invalid Height  Given I am logged in When I try to add a new product And I provide -1 as the height Then I see an invalid height error  Scenario: Invalid Width  Given I am logged in When I try to add a new product And I provide -1 as the width Then I see an invalid width error  Scenario: Invalid Length  Given I am logged in When I try to add a new product And I provide -1 as the length Then I see an invalid length error  	
22405567	Programming to an interface with required parameter values	I want to get statistics information from some sort of storage. Since I want to be able to switch storage I would like to use an interface and program towards it.  There are some requirements that I need to put on the implementations though, such as only accepting a certain range of strings. I am not sure how to accomplish this in a nice way. I currenctly have an interface specifying the methods. I also have an abstract class that implements the interface and is validating the string value in its constructor. I am curious if my current setup is good or if there are better ways of doing it. Below is a code sample.  public interface IStaticsRepository {     int GetApiStatistics(string apiId); }  public abstract class StatisticsReposity : IStatisticsRepository {     public readonly ICollection&lt;string&gt; ValidTimeUnits = new[] { 'hour', 'day' };      public StatisticsRepository(string timeUnit)     {         if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(timeUnit))         {             throw new ArgumentNullException('timeUnit');         }          if (!ValidTimeUnits.Contains(timeUnit))         {             throw new ArgumentException('Now a valid time unit.', 'timeUnit');         }          public abstract int GetApiStatistics(string apiId);     }      public class MongoDbStatisticsRepository : StatisticsRepository     {         public MongoDbStatisticsRepository(string timeUnit)             : base(timeUnit)         { }          public override int GetApiStatistics(string apiId)         { }     }  	
21910681	Apple appstore guidelines - Loading progression	I'm trying to figure out if it is a requirement for apps submitted to the iOS appstore to show the progression of data being down/loaded (by means of a progress bar or something similar) or if simply letting the user know that loading is in progress is sufficient. My app generally only loads for 2 seconds so i figure showing a progress bar is not really necessary but if it is a requirement then obviously i have no choice. Here's hoping someone can enlighten me :)  	
21726933	Examples of domain models that most people don&#39;t understand. Usage: create requirements	I'm looking for domain models in which most people don't know or understand very good. I have chosen one domain, health insurance policy, and I'm making requirements (user stories) for that domain. Later I will do some testing with users to investigate domain understanding. This is an perfect example, and I'm looking for more of these: http://www.uml-diagrams.org/examples/health-insurance-policy-domain-diagram-example.html  Since I have limited knowledge with the domains as well, I find the UML-representation and the description very useful. To be able to create some requirements I do need to understand the domain at least some of it.   That's it for now, I hope somebody got some input, I'll be searching the web.  	
21701582	Are requisites required, or is order sufficient?	The Salt docs are full of this kind of pattern:  apache:   pkg:     - installed   service:     - running     - require:       - pkg: apache   This repetition ('install apache, now check whether apache was installed') seems to be a violation of don't-repeat-yourself (DRY). So is it necessary?  From 'Understanding State Ordering':     To accomplish something similar to how classical imperative systems function all requisites can be omitted and the failhard option then set to True in the master configuration, this will stop all state runs at the first instance of a failure.   This seems to imply that the use of requisites everywhere is actually optional (assuming that the declaration order is correct) - but I'd like to know for sure.

3506533	Javascript based spell-checkers for web applications	I have just received a requirement to implement spell checking on a web application that we are creating.  I know all about FF, Chrome, IESpell, etc. but this one is the client's request.    Given that the only way to implement something like this (real time) is with JavaScript libraries, I want to know has anyone tried any of the open source ones?  Were they any good?  In general, what types of good/bad things can be said about this approach?   I guess going into this, I am against it as it is just more work for the end users's machine to do for little benefit.  I guess what I mean by that is that it will be a script that is constantly doing something as opposed to an AJAX request or a quick div update which could lead to seemingly bad performance for our application even though it is a spell checker checking every input field on the page.  It seems also that there is lots of room for a javascript error to stall the entire site.  Thoughts? 	
21090065	how complete should SBE specifications be?	I'm working on a fairly large existing code base where SBE specifications are created to define the behavior of the product.  There are currently around 450 scenarios, and this number is growing with each new feature added to the code base.  Compared to traditional one line requirement statements, it is difficult to get a high level understanding of the functionality of the system due to wordy nature of the SBE specifications.  As an example, the stories currently have a total of 46,830 words:  $ find src/main/resources/stories/ -name *.story | xargs cat | wc -w    46830   One other issue is that we are using gerrit code review tool for collaborating on stories, which is resulting in formalized communication between the team.  Question 1: Should the SBE's be a complete and comprehensive regression test suite (example)? Or, should they only focus on the key functionality required in each sprint?  Question 2: As mentioned on the answer here, are tools such as issue trackers required to manage stories for large projects? 	
9477750	Requirements to Specification Mapping Tools	Our team captures user stories in TFS. I use the great tool TeamSpec to dump these into a word document for good 'ol fashioned easy reading.  Now, we are at the point where we need to produce a functional specification that describes the software that will be built to support those user stories.  Again, I'd probably like this functional spec in word ultimately - as this has to be a readable document that the customer can read and sign off on.  That said, I would really love to have a tool that helps me map user stories to functional requirements, possibly even generating the matrix (in both directions) for easy reference.  What tools are there that might help me? Googling is no help at all. :)  Thanks in advance! 	TRUE

I also have auto-complete such that I can hit the tab key and get clues, like this  PROMPT&gt;zodiacSign=C&lt;TAB&gt;          Cancer          Capricorn PROMPT&gt;zodiacSign=Ca   The thing is that I'm getting more and more subtle requirements which I'm finding more and more difficult to document into User Stories. For example, I just received the requirement where if I hit carriage-return for the following:  PROMPT&gt;zodiacSign=Can&lt;CARRIAGE-RETURN&gt;   The software should then auto-complete the command zodiacSign=Cancer and execute it since it is the only option.   I will put in place function tests to test each of these nuances. By doing this, I can demo User Stories via my Function Tests.

17852409	Requirements Catalogue &amp; UML Models	Looking for a bit of a steer on 'how things are done' with regards to defining requirements for a software based project.  I'm fully up to speed with what goes into a requirements catalogue and how useful UML modelling can be.  My question, how are the two linked? Should you write out requirements into the catalogue for any requirements you model using UML - essentially duplicating requirements?  For example,   - A user wishes to source a 'product' from a supplier  - To do this they will enter their product details into a 'breifing' form  - In this scenario I'd look to use a class diagram to list out all the 'briefing' fields (shown on the briefing form) against a 'product' class  But, how do I tie those requirements back to the requirements catalogue? If they're not referenced there how will a developer know those requirements exist?   Any help greatly appreciated!  Thanks, Dan  	TRUE

19338788	Do BDD/ATDD stories replace the need for traditional requirements?	From what I can tell from online forums and posts, one of the main focuses of BDD/ATDD seems to be on discussion and ensuring that the customer, developers, testers and other relevant parties are involved in the understanding what the system must do.   Question 1: Do BDD/ATDD stories replace the need for traditional requirement specifications, such as the those captured using the Volere Template?  Because the traditional requirement specifications are one of the key inputs for developers and testers, traditional requirement specifications tend to be comprehensive.  Question 2: Should BDD/ATDD stories also be comprehensive enough to allow a system to be fully tested? 	TRUE
17244903	Different types of software requirements specification standards	So I am doing this research for a course project and I am told to find different types of standards of SRS documents in software development. Now I know one of them is IEEE standard that is used universally but are there more? I searched but I all I found was different variations of the IEEE standard but not a different standard all together.   Does anyone know about these other standards? Any help would be appreciated.   Thanks! 	TRUE
7250269	MKS Integrity for Requirements	I noticed posts on here about MKS Integrity as compared to other source code control. Has anyone been using MKS Integrity to manage requirements? How is it going? I'd appreciate any insights about it if:   you install it and use it   evaluated it but decided to go with something else   I noticed that it advertises that it can do lots of other things and possibly tie in with other systems (JIRA, Test Link?) to coordinate processes (bug tracking, testing and coverage) - how sophisticated is the integration? Anybody trying to report across all these integrated systems?  lots of questions with possibly big answers ... i know ... but any comment on any point would be appreciated from the stack overflow universe :) 	
13310268	Are there Agile software design methodologies?	I've been reading about Agile and it seems to be about making it easier to respond to changing requirements, evolutionary software design, getting working software over building a foundation, being able to deliver at any time, constant refactoring, etc. but I haven't really found anything pertaining to how to actually take requirements and translate them into software designs in a way that would help facilitate the mentioned 'goals' of Agile development besides following SOLID, use design patterns, and other guidelines.   Are there any methodologies out there that would help take me from requirements to software with Agile goals in mind? 	TRUE
11687326	Functional Software Requirement Specification and Project Timeline	I don't have any experience in writing Requirement specification.   I am writing a new in house web application in .Net and i have been given a document with all the requirments for this new software.  There is a (in house written) time tracking system in use at the moment but i have been asked to redesign it in .Net.  I am the only one in the company with software development experience and as this is internal software so they are not expecting me to write very detail documentation for that.  I have designed the ERD diagram for the database schema, I have also divided the requirements into different sections in the excel sheet and set there priority (L,M,H) and  Phases (1,2,3) for delivery.  My line manager has asked me to define the timeline for this project which is bit difficult as I will be working only 3 days a week on this project and don’t know how long it will take to complete the phase 1 as there are few other projects I am working on.     Do I really need to a Requirement Specification document because I have been given one in the word documents (in simple words) or Should I just stick with the one I have designed (divided in different sections). If I do need one then is there any example I can follow?      Do i also need a Function specification document? Is it different than Requirement Specification?       How do you normally set the timeline for the project? I have just defined the different tasks from database development to software development including and set the roughly days next to them.  	TRUE

17820166	Will legitimate email ever be sent TO mailer-daemon@?	I seem to be getting a rash of spam addressed to mailer-daemon@ my domain. I also get a lot of spam to postmaster@ and I live with that because RFC 5321 requires that to be a valid address. But does mailer-daemon@ need to accept mail?  Legitimate bounce messages come from mailer-daemon@ so I don't want to block based on sender address, but I was wondering if it's OK to block based on recipient address.  Is there any requirement to accept mail sent to mailer-daemon@? Will legitimate mail ever be sent to mailer-daemon@?  I didn't see mailer-daemon@ mentioned in RFC 5321. My search attempts showed lots of results for messages from mailer-daemon@, but nothing about messages to mailer-daemon@.  Oh and if I block mail to mailer-daemon@, should I just discard it instead of rejecting it? Will rejecting it cause a loop?

You should include initial positions loads, fault tolerance and error checking and handling for the process.   Thanks 	TRUE
17098860	When does WCF service call it&#39;s constructor?	I have a default configuration service (I believe this is per session). I am slightly confused about the WCF initialization policy. I've read a lot of suggestions towards not using constructors to begin with, but in my case, it seems like the intuitive to do along with changing to per-request mode from per-session.  Basically I have information passed in the HTTP headers that is required in all of the public interface methods, so it makes sense to parse them in a single method that's executed. Then again, I keep hoping that there's actually a better way to do this as I want to use the per-session model.  How can I execute such header parsing code before the actual methods? Furthermore, lets say I manage to do it - is there a way to disable this sort of behavior on a single method?  [edit] Also, say it works on per-session basis. Can I trust that the same initialization, when called again by a client, is serving the same client (I assume this is what per-session means, but security is important in my service so I'd rather be sure). 	
17002422	Different meaning of stakeholders in Scrum. Is a dev team a stakeholder?	Generally, I have learned that stakeholders (in general) are parties interested in the project - development team, testing team, QA team, management, customer (of course) etc. But now in Scrum, it says that the stakeholders are the ones who validate the product and the product is done for them, based on their needs. That would imply it means just the customer. Is it right or I misunderstood, is a development team really a stakeholder?  http://www.scrumalliance.org/articles/21-contracts-for-implementing-scrum     Stakeholders are parties with an interest in the product being   developed and/or the Scrum process. They might include suppliers,   customers, the business owner, subject matter experts, or product   support.   http://thescrumblog.blogspot.cz/2011/04/stakeholders-and-feedback-in-scrum.html  The Scrum Team: A lot of people forget that the Scrum team is a major stakeholder for the project  	TRUE
109141	How do you manage a large product backlog?	We have a large backlog of things we should do in our software, in a lot of different categories, for example:   New problem areas for our products to solve  New functionality supporting existing problem areas New functionality requested by our existing users Usability and 'look' enhancements Architectural upgrades to the back-end Bug fixes   Managing all of these in a sensible fashion is a job that falls to Product Management, but it is tricky for a lot of reasons.  Firstly, we have a number of different systems that hold the different things (market requirements document in files, bugs in a bug database, customer requirements in our help desk system, enginering's wish-list on our intranet, etc).  And secondly, many of the items are of wildly different size, scope, complexity and of course value, which means that choosing isn't as simple as just ordering a list by priority.    Because we now are fairly large, have a complex product and lots of customers, the basic solutions (a spreadsheet, a google doc, a basecamp to-do list) just isn't sufficient to deal with this.  We need a way to group things together in various ways, prioritise them on an ongoing basis, make it clear what we're doing and what is coming - without it requiring all of someone's time to just manage some tool.  How do you manage this in a way that allows the business to always do what is most valuable to existing customers, helps get new ones, and keeps the software innards sane?  Note that this is different from the development-side, which I think we have down pretty well.  We develop everything in an iterative, agile fashion, and once something has been chosen for design and implementation, we can do that.  It's the part where we need to figure out what to do next that's hardest!  Have you found a method or a tool that works?  If so, please share!  (And if you would like to know the answer too, rate up the question so it stays visible :)  Addendum: Of course it's nice to fix all the bugs first, but in a real system that actually is installed on customers' machines, that is not always practical.  For example, we may have a bug that only occurs very rarely and that it would take a huge amount of time and architectural upheaval to fix - we might leave that for a while.  Or we might have a bug where someone thinks something is hard to use, and we think fixing it should wait for a bigger revamp of that area.  So, there are lots of reasons why we don't just fix them all straight away, but keep them open so we don't forget.  Besides, it is the prioritization of the non-bugs that is the hardest; just imagine we don't have any :) 	TRUE
756850	Security Requirements for Medical Applications	I'm doing research on coding requirements for medical applications but I can't find anything useful/structured. Basically I'm looking for structured (if possible XML file) document with the list of security requirement. For example what kind of encryption they should use, what features of the app should be disabled by the default, what log info should be stored and how to store it, etc.  Of course requirements can be different for different apps and companies, i just need some general information and if possible for the US.

16481343	symfony2 routing requirements combining 2 parameters	So I got this in my routing.yml:  requirements:     var1: \d+     var2: \d+   Both are checked on their own and valid. I need to check the combination of the 2, since the combination is not always valid.  For this case I need to check the relation between 2 objects in the database, the first should be the parent of the second. I can do this in the controller, but I don't really like that implementation. Also, I need this same check for more than 1 route.  How would I add another requirement that checks the combination? Can I define a method in the controller class that would be called?  Or would the best solution be something like:  public function indexAction($var1, $var2) {     $result = $this-&gt;checkRelation($var1, $var2);     if ($result) {         // return errorpage         return $result;     }      // ...  }  	
16843908	Symfony2 - force use to complete required action	There are business cases where specific actions or requests 'must' be followed by a finishing action or request.  An example we are all familiar with is the requirement to log-in to access secure areas.  This may include cases where a certain event or problem has occurred and must be immediately addressed.  This would be enforced by the entire system redirecting a user to a page, and only a specific set of continuation requests are allowed.  Now I do know ways to implement this in Symfony2 (add request listeners and redirect when required), however, currently I do not have a full grasp of the best practice to do this, my main concern is how to safely specify which actions count as valid continuations.  What I am looking for is either a) the best methodology to deal with this, or b) details on any existing bundles or features already built into Symfony2 that are designed to do this.  I am a bit worried that I may have answered by own question when I mentioned the log-in system, however I have yet to study the internal workings of Symfony2's Security Bundle to determine whether the code is reusable.

16287444	OS X distribution.dist automated validation/evaluation	I am doing some research to see whether I can automatically/programatically validate a distribution.dist file that came from a valid os x pkg/dmg.  Here is the situation: I have some valid os x applications in dmg and pkg format. I have extracted their distribution.dist files and would like to determine which machines (let's assume there are many) these packages would install successfully on. I don't want to copy the entire pkg/dmg files to every machine and then run the 'installer' command to see if the installation would succeed or fail. This would consume excessive bandwidth/resources. Instead, I would like to do something more lightweight like use a script/command/binary that could evaluate only the distribution.dist requirements on the machine and then return if they are met or not.  I figure the hardest part of solving this problem would be how the 'Installer Javascript' scripts would be executed/evaluated. Since I do not see that Apple has given external access to those particular libraries.   One idea I have is to use pkgbuild and create pkg files with no payload. Then I could use the '/usr/sbin/installer' command to 'install' these 'empty' pkgs. The install checks would be performed and the file size would be small. However, I am hoping there is a more elegant way of solving this problem.  Thanks. 	
16188485	Requirements for a personal project	Gathering requirements is an essential stage creating software or web applications.  I have searched the web extensively without finding any directions on how to elicit requirements for personal projects. All information i found - including books i read - is focussing on different stakeholders.   So i´m wondering, what would be the best way to 'gather' the requirements for personal projects?  I can't imagine i'm the only one with this question. I have plenty of ideas for webapplications. Since i am the only stakeholder at this time - no users are identified yet, i need to develop a couple of applications for personal use - i find it hard to interview my self to elicit those requirements.  As English is not my native language, apologies for possible textual errors. 	TRUE

15409974	Requirements that base on alrady existing requirements	Let's assume that there is a working system with planty of functions and the system is now going to be adjust for another country. Some functions stay as they are, some are going to be adjust and some are going to be define from scratch.  In which form would you write requirements in this situation? Should the new specification mentione about already existing functions? Should every function be described new? If there is a big use case which needs a small change for the new country should it be describe complet or just the diff? What about the context for such small change so that developers understand what it is about? 	TRUE
1125446	How do you verify that users&#39; requirements are addressed in the code you&#39;re working on?	Code can be perfect, and also perfectly useless at the same time. Getting requirements right is as important as making sure that requirements are implemented correctly.   How do you verify that users' requirements are addressed in the code you're working on? 	TRUE
3571535	Good interview questions for designers/requirement-writers	I'm trying to come up with a quick question or exercise to evaluate interviewees' design and communication skills for a requirements-writing position.  I've considered asking for a quick recipe (like for a grilled cheese sandwich), but that doesn't quite feel right. (recipes describe how to make something; requirements describe the resulting object itself).  I'm interested both in suggestions, and examples of good (or bad) questions you've been asked. 	TRUE
225154	Good pointers that a software requirement is in fact political?	Probably an easy one:  Are there any rules of thumb or pointers that could help recognise political requirements?  Let’s say one of stakeholders (your boss, a head of another department or an actual user) asks for a feature or particular characteristic of software being developed by yourself or your team. Is there a litmus test to determine whether requirement is political?  This question is really simple and is not about how to deal with political requirements or whether they are bad or good for software. How do you tell that whatever you have been asked to do is to pursue someone’s tacit or actually openly stated political agenda? 	TRUE
15152611	Is there a programming language that meets these requirements?	I have a few requirements before implementing my next program - hopefully a programming language exists that can do the following:   Given a class (or interface) C, the programming language allows the user access to a list of all classes which extend/implement C. The programming language allows the user to iterate through all the variables and methods of a class. The user is able to determine the number and types of arguments a function will take.  eg. foo(int a, String b, int c) can be queried  to return 3 or [int, String, int]    Are these absurd requirements or does some language implement them as basic techniques of reflection? 	
14931780	More productive Grooming Sessions	I'm looking for a way to make our Scrum Grooming Sessions more productive. At the moment, it feels like it's taking us a long time to create user stories and acceptance criteria. For a one hour session, we typically end up with 2 - 4 user stories including acceptance criteria. The process to get there feels painful, taking a long time.  Participants include members from Dev + Architecture, QA, BA, Customer, Product Owner (me), Usability.  The problem I see is that we have good discussions, but then the process of wording the stories - and even more so the Acceptance Criteria - takes an awfully long time.  Since we are a distributed team, we have to do this over the phone, screen sharing and a collaborative editing environment. This certainly has an impact on the productivity, since we're not in the same room, but I still feel that our process could be improved.  Some questions:   How many stories do you typically end up with after a Grooming Session? Do you create the Acceptance Criteria as part of the Grooming Session, or outside? How do you create User Stories and what process works for you?  	TRUE
14854034	Doxygen requirements tracking / inverse matrix	I use a custom Doxygen tag to track requirement implementations in my software source code, like so :  /// @req REQ-BLAH-0010   The @req tag is defined in my doxygen.conf file:  ALIASES += 'req=\xrefitem req \'Requirement\' \'Requirements\' '   This works, Doxygen generates a list of requirements for each method/class/file. But sometimes the same requirement number is used in different places, and I'd like a way to get the inverse list: for each requirement number, list all the places in which it is tracked.  Is this possible to do using Doxygen? If so, how? If not, what tool would you recommend for this?

What is the earliest version of windows I can run the program on? I know that it can depend on what Windows API functions that you use in the program, so I only use the following functions in my program:   GetStdHandle() SetConsoleTextAttribute()   Everything else in the program is standard C++. I know that console applications should be able to run on very early versions of Windows, but I do not know how VC++ 2010's compilation affects the minimum operating system requirement.

14649905	EDI x12 Segment Conditions	Keep in mind that I started to tackle EDI standars a couple of days ago only so there are still a lot of nebulous things.  In an EDI segment (like CUR), when a condition is declared (P0304) it states that if one is use, the other should too.  What do them mean by 'use'?  Does it mean that the field has to be present in the segment or does it have to have a value in it? Can it be empty but still 'used'?  i.e. : CUR*SE*CAD**01  Would it be valid, since CUR03 is in the segment? Or would it be invalid because CUR03 is empty? 	
14486987	How are requirements of network specified to ensure QoS?	When I review the hardware requirements of many database backed enterprise solutions, I find requirements for the application server (OS, processor, RAM, disk space, etc), for the database server (versions, RAM, etc) and requirements for the client.  Here is an example of Oracle Fusion Middleware.  I cannot find requirements on network speed or architecture (switch speed, SAN IOPS,RIOPS, etc).  I do not want a bad user experience from my application but caused by network latency in the clients environment.  When sending clients required hardware requirements specifications, how do you note the requirements in these areas?  What are the relevant measures of network performance? (Or is it simply requiring IOPS=x ) 	
147182	Low Friction Minimal Requirements Gathering	How can our team gather requirements from our 'Product Owner' in as low friction yet useable of a way as possible?  Now here's the guidelines- No posts that it can't be done or that the business needs to make a decision that it cares about quality, yada yada. The product I work for is a small group that has been successful for years. I just want to help them step it up a notch.  Basically, I'm on a 6 or 7 person team with one Product Owner. She does a great job but is juggling a few different roles (as I believe is common on extremely small teams). Usually requirements are given at sporadic times (email convos, face to face discussions, meetings, etc). They are never entered into a system and sometimes this results in features missing a release or the release getting pushed back since everyone forgot about the necessary feature.  If you're in a similar situation but you found a way to overcome this, I'd love to hear it. I'm happy to write code to help ease this situation but it can't be a web site that the Product Owner has to go to in order to get anything done. She is extremely busy and we need some way of working together as a team in order to gather these requirements.  I'm currently thinking of something like this: Developers and team members gather requirements discussed in face to face meetings and write some quick notes on the features discussed on a wiki page. Product owner is notified whenever these pages are updated and it then becomes her responsibility to ensure accuracy.  Pros: We'll have some record of the features. Cons: The developers are taking responsibility for something that they ordinarily wouldn't. I'm okay with that here. I think in this situation it's teamwork.  Of course once we do this, then we're going to see that the product owner probably doesn't have enough time to ensure feature accuracy. Ultimately she is overburdened and I think this will help showcase that fact, but I just need to be able to draw attention to that first.  So any suggestions?  P.S. her time is extremely limited so it is considered unreasonable to expect her to need to type in the requirements after discussion. She only has time to discuss them once and move on. 	TRUE

6165775	How to write technical requirements	What is the right way to write technical requirements for the UI component in an application? I guess it's not clear to me whether the technical requirement should dictate how the UI should be implemented or it should be as general as possible and describe what are required to satisfy the functional requirements and forget about the implementation details.   Here are my specific questions:   Should it state what technology the UI will be implemented in? (eg, ActiveX, WPF, HTML).  Should I describe the layout, the colors? (given that that can change) Is it necessary to describe how the data is presented? (eg, does it need to say 'data is displayed in a table or list format' or 'a scrollbar shall appear is data cannot be fit on the screen'?) Do I need to describe how the UI should react to user input if that is a functional requirement? (eg, the functional requirement says 'it shall be clear to the user which action is current active'... should the technical requirement say 'the button shall change color to Red when user selects option a.. Blue when user selects option b.. etc') Is it necessary to state things that are common sense about the UI? For example,'it shall be position in such a way the entire content is visible'? or 'it shall have shadow so that it stands out from the rest of the screen'? (note: these are not functional requirements but they apply to any UI in general)  	TRUE
14200944	What do I need to know to build an HTTP server in C?	Some say that in order to build an HTTP server I should follow the RFC 2616 standards. Which is ok, but as a completely new C developer I would like to know what modules, techniques I will need to make implement the HTTP protocol to handles html, css, js and images.  I'm not trying to reinvent the well I just need a starting point to learn C. And my experience is that building something useful in a project manner is the best way to learn something new.  P.S. I would like to build it from scratch if it's possible.

I am writing an intermediate submission report for a project that I am re-engineering and my tutor wants a page summary, list of requirements (with justifications), an initial scope and a suggested architecture.  The main report will include analysis, design and implementation.  I've written everything apart from the initial scope. I'm really worried I'm going to repeat myself and I am unsure as to what the difference between my requirements and initial scope should be?

1957895	Defining minimum memory and free disk space requirements?	On page 42 of Code Code complete there's a checklist of requirement items you might want to consider during a requirement phase. On of the items (near the bottom of the list) says Are minimum machine memory and free disk space specified Has this ever been a requirement in any project you did and how did you define such a requirement before even starting to build stuff?  I know this is only a suggestion and frankly I don't think I will ever include that in my requirements, but it got me thinking (and this is the real question)..   How would one ever make an estimation of system requirements...

12425570	How do I declare device capabilities for this app?	I have created an iOS 5.1 or later application for the iPhone 4S that requires a magnetometer, an accelerometer and also uses the Core Location framework  Apple's documentation is a bit confusing when it comes to declaring the device's required capabilities (confused over array or dictionary choice, entering YES/NO values, etc.) and I want to make sure I've added everything correctly.  This is what the relevant section of my info.plist looks like now :  Required Device Capabilities      Array    (4 items)           item 0                  String   magnetometer           item 1                  String   accelerometer           item 2                  String   location-services           item 3                  String   armv7 // was already added by default   (I have also added the name of the app and an appIcon in the appropriate fields)  Is the above information correct or do I need to add something more or change something?  Furthermore, the application was created to run on the iPhone 4S. But do the above requirements also let it run on other iPhone versions that I should include, or is the iOS 5.1 restriction limiting my app to only run on the iPhone 4S?  Should I also include somewhere that it can run on some version of iPod Touch or will it not run on one?  Thank you for your suggestions 	
11486309	Unified Process Analysis and Software Percentage Confusion	I want to ask something about Unified Process. In UP, every iteration has its own analysis and implementation steps.         But the above image shows something different. After iteration 5, 90% of analysis completed but just 10% of software completed. I can't understand that. In an iteration, codes are about iteration's requirements. So how could be software's completion ratio 10% and requirements' ratio 90%?

Can Linux users who have open-source graphics drviers run OpenGL 3.x? I know that Mesa3D 7.8 only supports OpenGL 2.1.  I also know that OS X Snow Leopard supports some but not all OpenGL 3.0 features. I don't know the situation on Leopard.  I don't know the situation on XP, Vista, and Windows 7.  I'd like to start learning OpenGL, and my interest lies more in scientific and engineering applications than games. I know I'll be reading code that uses OpenGL 1.x, but I'd like to write code using the newest specification I can expect user's systems to support. I'm wondering whether I should start learning 2.1 or 3.3. I was thinking of getting either the 4th edition of the OpenGL Superbible to learn 2.1 or the 5th edition which is coming out July 30 to learn 3.3. (I have a bachelor's in physics, so my math background is pretty good.)    Edit: I found this related question with answers that are relevant to my question.

9259321	Do these stacks need to be merged?	In a proficiency assessment as part of Exam 98-361, Software Development Fundamentals, this question pops up:     Scenario 3-3: Using Stacks      You are writing a program that uses two stacks. The data in each stack is already in descending order. You need to process the contents of both stacks in such a way that the output is printed on the screen ascending order. How would you write such a program?   Now, I have this scenario already coded. My solution is to iterate over two separate stacks, merge them into a List by popping their items off until the stack is empty, and sort the list into the correct order.  However, it strikes me that the question is a bit vague on whether or not I should be merging the stacks. It's kind of implied, but it kind of isn't.  If you were reading this question, how would you interpret it?  Note that I'm not actually taking this exam, just prepping for it. It's more of a requirements interpretation issue, at this point, in my mind. 	
479739	How do you manage customers with regards to changing requirements?	Steve Yegge's wisdom notwithstanding, most developers are faced with requirements which were gathered from non-technical customers.  Sometimes there are project managers who deal with the customers and translate their requirements, other times not.  In any event, the fact that the requirements will change is an inevitability.  Most of what consititues 'good programming practice' has to do with developing systems which are adaptable so that they can withstand changing requirements.  Principles like YAGNI, DRY, loose coupling, etc. contribute to this.  Iterative development processes such as Agile also attempt to address the concern of trying to hit a moving target, and of course having a system under test makes it infinitely more feasible to make changes.  Nonetheless, it seems that for many of us changing requirements can not only hurt the quality of our software, but can also drain our motivation and make us want to stab someone.  This question is about how to manage the customer to make it possible for them to change their requirements in the ways that they need, while discouraging arbitrary or frivolous changes.  How do you do it?   Do you have project managers to insulate the devs from the customer? Do you have a formal change management process?  Change managers? How difficult is it for the customer to get a change when they really need it? Conversely, how easy is it for a customer to get a change when it's 'frivolous'? How much detail do you give the customer when explaining the cost of a change? How quickly are you able to give the customer this information after receiving a request for change? What factors can torpedo the process (e.g. PM's who can't say no to the customer?) What works for you?  	TRUE

123089	How do you avoid waiting for requirements when using iterative agile development methods like SCRUM?	We attempt to do agile development at my current job and we succeed for the most part. The main problem seems to be that the developers on the project are always waiting for requirements at the beginning of the sprint and rushing to get get things down by the end. The business analysts who are delivering the requirements are always working non-stop to get the requirements done.  EDIT: Additional Information: We are customizing a COTS application for our internal use. Our 'user stories' just consist of what part of the application we will be customizing in the specific sprint and also what systems we will integrate with internally. The integration with different systems normally works pretty well because we can start working on that right away. The 'customize x screen' are the main problems areas because the developers can't do anything from that. We have to wait until we get the requirements from the BAs before we can really do anything.  EDIT: More insight/confusion perhaps: I wonder if part of the problem is that the screen that are being customized are already there as this is a COTS product that is being heavily customized. People suggest that the user stories should be along the lines of 'make a screen that does X'. That's already done. Maybe there isn't a good way to do user stories for these requirements... maybe this need to be a whole new question. 	TRUE

10149588	C# Application doesn&#39;t seem to run on a similar computer to mine	Unfortunately I haven't quite found the awnser I was looking for in the search section or any other coding forums so I'll leave my question here hopping for some closure.  I've developed a very simple C# Application , one of Windows' startup projects - the maze one, which uses a simple panel with labels and simple mouse events to trigger the placement of the pointer's position back to start.  I have succesfully published my application and it works smoothly on my computer and a few others but for some weird reason it simply won't load on my friend's laptop.  We both share the same OS (Windows 7), we both have the x64 version and the framework seems to be the same, but even though the process is displayed in the task manager, it simply won't load, even after the installation is successful.  So , the program does run but it seems like it won't load and it does not throw any exceptions or errors to be analyzed.  Therefore my question is, what are the requirements for my programs to be fully compatible with other computers ?   I appreciate the attention , I've spent a lot of time working on this matter and can't seem to find the correct awnser.

My question is about the step before you start to use this Agile tools, create stories and iterations, and your developers start to make it grow on each one. My doubts are about the step of Technical, Functional and Non-Functional Software Requirements Specification, so after you have it clear, you can start writting up the stories:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement.    Are there tools that can guide you how to convert the idea of web app (or mobile app) into a list of stories/iterations in a successful way? some kind of visual representation of states, features or functions (and its relationships) where you can specified functional, non-functinal and tecnhical specs, so after that you can create stories?  thank you very much for your time and patient in advance.

983584	How to make your embedded C code immune to requirement changes without adding too much overhead and complexity?	In many embedded applications there is a tradeoff between making the code very efficient or isolating the code from the specific system configuration to be immune to changing requirements.  What kinds of C constructs do you usually employ to achieve the best of both worlds (flexibility and reconfigurabilty without losing efficiency)?  If you have the time, please read on to see exactly what I am talking about.  When I was developing embedded SW for airbag controllers, we had the problem that we had to change some parts of the code every time the customer changed their mind regarding the specific requirements. For example, the combination of conditions and events that would trigger the airbag deployment changed every couple weeks during development. We hated to change that piece of code so often.  At that time, I attended the Embedded Systems Conference and heard a brilliant presentation by Stephen Mellor called 'Coping with changing requirements'. You can read the paper here (they make you sign-up but it's free).  The main idea of this was to implement the core behavior in your code but configure the specific details in the form of data. The data is something you can change easily and it can even be programmable in EEPROM or a different section of flash.  This idea sounded great to solve our problem. I shared this with my colleague and we immediately started reworking some of the SW modules.  When trying to use this idea in our coding, we encountered some difficulty in the actual implementation. Our code constructs got terribly heavy and complex for a constrained embedded system.  To illustrate this I will elaborate on the example I mentioned above. Instead of having a a bunch of if-statements to decide if the combination of inputs was in a state that required an airbag deployment, we changed to a big table of tables. Some of the conditions were not trivial, so we used a lot of function pointers to be able to call lots of little helper functions which somehow resolved some of the conditions. We had several levels of indirection and everything became hard to understand. To make a long story short, we ended up using a lot of memory, runtime and code complexity. Debugging the thing was not straightforward either. The boss made us change some things back because the modules were getting too heavy (and he was maybe right!).  PS: There is a similar question in SO but it looks like the focus is different. Adapting to meet changing business requirements? 	TRUE

735609	Should I use formal methods on my software project?	Our client wants us to build a web-based, rich internet application for gathering software requirements.  Basically it's a web-based case tool that follows a specific process for getting requirements from stakeholders.  I'm the project manager and we're still in the early phases of the project.  I've been thinking about using formal methods to help clarify the requirements for the tool for both my client and the developers.  By formal methods I mean some form of modeling, possibly something mathematically-based.  Some of the things I've read about and are considering include Z (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_notation), state machines, UML 2.0 (possibly with extensions such as OCL), Petri nets, and some coding-level stuff like contracts and pre and post conditions.  Is there anything else I should consider?  The developers are experienced but depending on the formalism used they may have to learn some math.  I'm trying to determine whether it's worth while for me to use formal methods on this project and if so, to what extent.  I know 'it depends' so the most helpful answers for me is a yes/no and supporting arguments.  Would you use formal methods if you were on this project? 	TRUE

7852113	How to treat future requirements in terms of TDD	While attempting to adopt more TDD practices lately on a project I've run into to a situation regarding tests that cover future requirements which has me curious about how others are solving this problem.  Say for example I'm developing an application called SuperUberReporting and the current release is 1.4. As I'm developing features which are to be included in SuperUberReporting 1.5 I write a test for a new file export feature that will allow exporting report results to a CSV file. While writing that test it occurs to me that the feature to support exports to some other formats are slated for later versions 1.6, 1.7, and 1.9 which are documented in a issue tracking software. Now the question that I'm faced with is whether I should write up tests for these other formats or should I wait until I actually implement those features? This question hits at something a bit more fundamental about TDD which I would like to ask more broadly.  Can/should tests be written up front as soon as requirements are known or should the degree of stability of the requirements somehow determine whether a test should be written or not?  More generally, how far in advance should tests be written? Is it OK to write a test that will fail for two years until the that feature is slated to be implemented?

2169360	Personal tool for authoring &amp; organizing user stories?	My company uses Jira for storing requirements, which are written in the form of User Stories ('As a ... I want ... So that...') with details in the subtasks ('Given ... when ... then...').  I write requirements, usually an iteration ahead of the developers.  I tend to draft my requirements in a word processor before putting them in Jira. I like the flexibility as I'm working out the best way to organize the information, jumping around from one story to another, using search &amp; replace as I figure out the clearest wording, etc.  While a word processor outline is helpful for much of this, it's not so good at tracking issue links: dependencies &amp; related requirements.  So, can anybody recommend a good tool for writing stories &amp; tasks which allows me to diagram relationships as I write? I've been thinking in terms of something which handles concept mapping (though not mind mapping, which is generally limited to 1 central concept). This is just for my personal authoring; I don't need a project management system.  Thanks in advance.  Update: After posting this, I started wondering about TiddlyWiki. That's not quite the right tool, given its linking methods, but seems the right direction... Does that vein spark any ideas? 	TRUE

4338398	Scala: How to make requirements of the type parametres of generic classes?	I'm creating some parameterized classes C[T] and I want to make some requirements of the characteristics of the type T to be able to be a parameter of my class. It would be simple if I just wanted to say that T inherited from traits or classes (as we do with Ordering). But I want it to implement some functions as well.  For example, I've seen that many pre-defined types implement MinValue and MaxValue, I would like my type T to implement these too. I've received some advice to just define an implicit function. But I wouldn't like that all the users were obliged to implement this function for these when it is already implemented. I could implement them at my code too, but it seems just to be a poor quick fix.  For example, when defining heaps, I would like to allowd users to construct a empty Heap. In these cases I want to inicialize value with the minimum value the type T could have. Obviously this code does not works.  class Heap[T](val value:T,val heaps:List[Heap[T]]){     def this()=this(T.MinValue,List()) }   I also would love to receive some advice about really good online Scala 2.8 references. 	
7276954	Real requirements vs business requirements	Let's say I have an account creation form, which fills a user database. Let's say this database table has 6 columns: UserID, UserLogin, Password, Email, Demographic1, Demographic2.  The program really requires UserID, UserLogin, and Password. It can't function without. The rest are 'business requirements', the company would like to know these things. They are 'required'.  Would it be better to structure my application and database so that these are actually required, or to enforce this constraint in business logic?  My gut is telling me the 2nd choice, but in nearly all the production code I've seen, the 1st is usually the case.  Is this lack of planning, or some sort of imprinting on programmers from the business/pm (they tell me it's required, I'll make it required). Or, is there a compelling reason? 	TRUE

3025365	Traceability with XSD	I am trying to let my XML schema handle a little traceability functionality as I'm gathering requirements while I read through some functional specifications. (Not ideal for requirement management, but at least its a start.)  What I'm doing is creating a &lt;functionalSpec> tag for each functional specification I am currently reading through. I create a &lt;requirement> tag for each requirement I find. Since I want to be able to trace where the requirement came from, I create a &lt;trace> element with the id of the &lt;functionalSpec> element. Instead of allowing myself to enter any plain-old-text in the &lt;functionalSpecId> tag, I want the XSD to validate and make sure that I only enter in an id that exists for an existing functional spec. My problem is coming in where it seems the XML Schema W3C Recommendations documentation says that what I want to do is not possible. (about 1/2 way down)     {selector} specifies a restricted XPath ([XPath]) expression relative to instances of the element being declared. This must identify a node set of subordinate elements (i.e. contained within the declared element) to which the constraint applies.   I'm using Oxygen to create this since I'm fairly new to XSD files, and it gives me the following error:     E [Xerces] Identity Constraint error:  identity constraint 'KeyRef@1045a2' has a keyref which refers to a key or unique that is out of scope.   So my question is does anyone know of a way that will allow me to use the same XML structure that I have below through using XSD?  Below is the XML file.  &lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8' ?&gt;  &lt;srs xmlns:xsi='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance'     xsi:schemaLocation='srs req2.xsd'     xmlns='srs'&gt;  &lt;requirements&gt;

6135308	After specifying android.hardware.faketouch the app still requires android.hardware.touchscreen?	I've been working on an app that originally had no touchscreen requirements specified in it's manifest file, so according to the documentation android.hardware.touchscreen is assumed. Because the app doesn't require advanced gestures, a device with a faketouch screen (android.hardware.faketouch) should also be able to run the app, so I added that requirement to the manifest file for an update.  However, the Android market still lists android.hardware.touchscreen as a requirement (as well as android.hardware.faketouch), and I still can't find the updated app in the market on a faketouch device (HTC Wildfire).  These are the permissions, requirements and libraries I specified:  &lt;uses-library android:name='com.google.android.maps' /&gt; &lt;uses-permission android:name='android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION'&gt;&lt;/uses-permission&gt; &lt;uses-permission android:name='android.permission.INTERNET'&gt;&lt;/uses-permission&gt; &lt;uses-permission android:name='android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE' /&gt; &lt;uses-permission android:name='android.permission.CAMERA' /&gt; &lt;uses-feature android:name='android.hardware.camera' /&gt; &lt;uses-feature android:name='android.hardware.camera.autofocus' /&gt; &lt;uses-feature android:name='android.hardware.faketouch' /&gt; &lt;uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion='4'&gt;&lt;/uses-sdk&gt;   Is this a problem (perhaps the market remembers old requirements, or perhaps the Google Maps library inserts a touchscreen requirement) or is it normal to see both listed when specifying faketouch? 	
6287809	Verify System Requirements using Java	I'm new to Java and have been asked to create an applet/servlet (not sure which I should use to be honest, pretty sure applet) that will make sure that the user's machine meets the system requirements we have set.

I'd be extremely grateful for a point in the right direction. I've got a small script for the screen res already and I've been looking into Hyperic SIGAR for much of the rest (except the bandwidth stuff).  Questions: Is an applet the right direction? Is Java the right/best language? (this will be all done through a web page)  Any direction is greatly appreciated...

5811048	Can I create hierarchial Requirements document using TFS query or TFS Report	I am exploring feasibility of using TFS for software process on our next project.  One need is to be able to create a requirements document from individual linked requirements within TFS.  I've currently got mock-up projects in both Agile and CMMI with a set of requirements linked with parent child relationships.  I can query these requirements in both Agile and CMMI but the result doesn't show the hierarchy.  With CMMI I can run the report 'Project Management::Requirements Progress' which shows requirement titles with indention based on hierarchy. It doesn't however show the detailed descriptions  What I'd like is to auto generate a Word document with hierarchical headings based on TFS requirement work items and their parent/child relationships.  Also to generate rich text and drawings from the TFS requirement Work Item descriptions.

Now I would like to link the Requirements Work Item to the source code file with the tests.  When I select the All Links tab in the Work Item window and then use the Link to button the dialog it brings up won't let me specify a source file.

If I have the column set to allow null values, and only 100 of 100 000 rows have the field populated, will the rest still consume 4 bytes for every null value?

4294483	establishing functional requirements - level of detail	Where do you draw the line between functional requirements and aspects of design?   If i can illustrate, one function of my system is that it must implement a user hierarchy.   In this instance would the definition of what those hierarchies are come under requirements (assuming you already know what the user hierarchies are) or would they come under the design aspect of a project? 	TRUE
4275403	How to organize information about program solution?	Неllо. I develop system that works with stock exchange(system, below). And there is a lot of information my program need to interact with this system. This system has formal declared interface, but different details beside this declaration and requirements to my system is often changed.   So how can I organize available information about this system and requirements to my program that it could be both easy to understand and easy to change. 	TRUE
4250117	How to prove to colleagues that use-cases are important?	...  and how to prove to management that use-cases can be informal and still useful?  Hi folks,  I came in the middle of a project and found out that there are no use-cases, user-stories, requirements, neither anything similar to a specification. Since the deadlines are short, the current dev team don't want to spend time on such things. I wanted to join that project, but by digging more I found out that the current development adds features just by considering their 'wow-effect' and chooses what to add just by using the easiness that the underlying technology provides. I was surprised how they have managed to go so far (more than 4 months) without requirements, but this is what we have now. I believe that the way they have chosen is the most sure one to kill the product which has a good marketing value.  Am I right, and what would you do in a similar circumstances to prove the dev team/management to make use-cases/requirements before moving forward? Thanks in advance, kh.  P.S. Two copies of Cockburn's book are on the bookshelf... 	TRUE
4258010	Online wiki / documentation for project schema / requirements?	I have my development team who are across the world.

Only requirement is it should be free and if possible have some tools so i can show images / document database schema? 	
4128165	Removing 3G from supported devices	I'm trying to figure out how to remove the iPhone 3G as a supported device for my application in the AppStore.  I emailed Apple support asking for them to update it in the reqs section and they responded saying I need to update my UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities keys.  Well, it was submitted with :      &lt;key&gt;UIBackgroundModes&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;             &lt;string&gt;location&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;   and      &lt;key&gt;UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;             &lt;string&gt;telephony&lt;/string&gt;             &lt;string&gt;location-services&lt;/string&gt;             &lt;string&gt;gps&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;   in my plist.  Does anyone know what the exact key/value I'd need to set in order for 3G support to not be listed in the AppStore? 	
2285418	Which Windows versions (including service pack number) support the .NET Framework?	On which versions of Windows (including minimum service pack level, if necessary) is the .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 supported?  Also, is this information yet available for .NET 4.0?  Edit:  BarsMonster's link gives the operating system requirements of .NET 3.5 SP1, but unfortunately says nothing about required service packs. I know, for example, that rather than requiring 'Windows XP', .NET 3.5 SP1 actually requires XP SP2. Does anyone know the service pack requirements (if any) for the other Windows versions?  Also, for .NET 4, the link gives the requirements for the pre-release versions. Do we know if these are likely to change for RTM? 	
2807729	What name is given to tests that determine if a system will run an application?	I want to essentially check the environment and see if the necessary conditions for my application are in place.  That is not unit testing, what is the name for that?    EDIT:  I found an example whilst doing something else: otrs.checkModules, from the much-since-last-time-I-looked OTRS ticketing system.  That is what I am talking about. Hopefully that clarifies the question somewhat? 	
398586	How to determine minimum system requirements	How do you decide what the minimum system requirements are for a Windows application? (OS, RAM, HD, CPU). I usually go with my gut, but I'd like to be able to back that up with something. 	
136542	Best way to avoid scope creep as a developer with no project management	I'm a s/w developer in a small internal IT department within a financial firm and have worked on a number of small-medium sized projects that have had little or no project management throughout.  This seems to always result in scope creep and therefore not meeting deadlines and having to sacrifice good design/code to satisfy users/managers in the short term.  What can I do as a developer to ensure user requirements are nailed down before any code is written and that any change requests are properly managed, considering the demands and expectations of users/managers.    Thanks. 	TRUE

3932741	What is the relationship between requirements and test cases?	I see that there are many systems out there for requirements to test cases traceability and I started to ask myself what the relationship is between these two artefacts.  For example, why have the notion of test cases as opposed to just calling them detailed requirements?  Are test cases in fact a refinement of the requirements set?  If test cases are not requirements and require more than the documented requirements (e.g. testing more errors, etc) then surely the requirements set is incomplete?  Are requirements just abstract test cases? 	TRUE
2169549	Windows presentation layer using c# and .net hardware requirements	All,  If I were to develop a kiosk app using Windows presentation foundation, c# and .net, what hardware requirements would I need. I plan on making it a standalone desktop app. It would contain images, and about 1-2 minutes of video. What kind of CPU (pentium, dual-core, what clock speed, graphic card?, memory? )  What if I made the kiosk a web app? What hardware requirements would I need?  Thanks, Rohit 	
278535	What are the main differences between search engines that should influence the decision as to which to use to search proprietary data?	What are the main differences between search engines (DtSearch , Lucene.net, Sphinx, Google etc)  that should influence the decision as to which to use to search proprietary data?  The data to be searched consists of presentation-free data that is marked up with metadata in the form of name/value pairs. We’re not interested in the format parsing abilities of the tools various. Also, the search results need to be well structured, presentation-free data that is amenable to aggregating with search results from other (similarly structured repositories.   Some relevant search engine characteristics that need to inform the decision are listed below. Futther suggestions or description of experiences welcome.  •   Cost •   Ease of use •   Can be configured to return specific tags only •   Can ‘identify’ specific terms give search results higher weighting for these results •   Fast &lt; 0.3seconds to return search results or %E6 records/documents •   Support tags with types (find weather=’sunny’ but not personality=sunny) •   Support weightings to give relevancy ranking •   Return results in ranked order by relevency •   Supports Synonyms •   Supports stemmings •   Supports Stop words •   Supports spelling corrections •   Amenable to parallelisation or index building (if index based) •   Fast to reindex (if index based) •   Fast to update index (if index based) •   Combine results from multiple indexes (if index based) •   Proximity checks: give higher relevance to words found close together 	
2942027	What were the requirement elicitation techniques before use cases?	I had a little presentation for my coworkers about use case elicitation and then one of them asked 'What were the requirement elicitation techniques before use cases? And how use cases are better than previous methods?' I have no idea, can anybody help? 	TRUE
3717105	Architectural principles as &quot;non-functional&quot; user stories	I am about to start a pilot project in our company to introduce agile practices, including the use of user stories. After reading two books by Mike Cohn, Agile Estimating and Planning in particular and User Stories Applied, I now have a clearer idea of how to proceed. I have confidence in refining  our techniques along with practice.  However there is one thing that does not convince me. In this blog post Mike Cohn defines a specific type of user stories, which he called constraints, which can be used to define the so-called non-functional requirements. Personally I do not like the word constraint and even the use of the classic template 'As a ..., I want ..., so that ...'.  Rather I will try make the customer to write, always on the cards, perhaps with the above template, those that Nick Rozanski and Eoin Woods called, in their fantastic book Software Systems Architecture, architectural principles:     'An architectural Principle is a statement of belief, approach, or intent that guides the definition of an architecture.'   (they also divide these principles into business principles and technology principles, a differentiation I think we should not care of.)  What I would like to do with these principles cards is to put them next to our backlog cards board in order to have them always present during the user stories definition and the planning activities. I would also encourage customers and developers to pick them up and put them next to the iteration board each time they think a card could be useful as a reminder for the team.  Have you ever tried any similar approach? Do you discourage it for any reason? Have you any suggestion on this matter? 	TRUE
3511304	What are some good specification/requirements document items for a small iPhone app project?	I'm whipping up a short specifications/requirements document for a small prototype iPhone app project.  Describing the basic functionality and behavior is not an issue for me.  But, since my mobile application and iPhone development knowledge is very weak, I'm not really sure what else should be in such a document regarding best practices and such.  Example: In my programming world (server side Java), when spec'ing a project for outsourcing, I state that the project must pass static bug analysis by FindBugs.  Example: I understand that there are API calls Apple does not want app developers invoking.  These can be cause for having an app rejected from the app store.  But I'm not sure how to say that we want Apple's guidelines respected.  (I don't even know how to test for that.)  What should I include in a two-page requirements and specification document that is specific to iPhone app development? 	TRUE
68178	Need a wiki where I can export to Word	I'm looking for a wiki that I can use to track requirements for a project, but we would like to be able to export the wiki (with formatting) to Microsoft Word.  Does anyone know of a wiki that does this? 	
3558961	RSS feed and program updates in MFC app	My boss wants me to write a simple RSS feed for an C++ MFC app that will pull and display information from the company's website. It also must be able to grab program updates from the website, tell the user that there are updates and then install the updates. Are there any tutorials that follow these guide lines? How would stackoverflow.com implement these requirements? Libraries, tutorials or guidance would all be great!  	
3514193	In Scrum or other Agile processes - how do you handle requirement versions	In Scrum and/or other Agile methods how do you handle versions of requirements simply? I assume that there are plenty of organisations who are Agile but also need to keep a track of requirement changes for regulatory purposes and so on.  You may have a requirement in version 1 which is substantially altered in version 8. How do you track that kind of change between releases? 	TRUE
3489696	How do I calculate minimum system requirements?	For the apps I'm writing in Visual C#? 	
3463971	Synchronization of CaliberRM Requirements with TFS 2010	Has any found an easy way to synchronize requirements stored in CaliberRM with requirement work items in TFS 2010?  In the past, Borland produced an add-in to CaliberRM to do so.  But, the current version only supports TFS 2008 and we were told that there is no plans to support TFS 2010.  I think I might have to write my own synchronizer, but I'm hoping I don't have to re-invent the wheel. 	
3402289	How to model and track requirements towards a goal in PHP	I'm building a webapp using the Zend Framework, and I need to model logic or keep track of some logic that has to do with tracking progress towards a goal.    Let me illustrate with a sample goal.       USER Needs to Complete All Three of the following:   A) Activity One   B) Activity Two   C) Activity Three   USER Needs to Complete One of the following:   D) Activity Four   E) Activity Five   F) Activity Six   After completing all three from the first group and one from the second group the USER has completed that goal.  How would I go about modeling this in PHP so that the webapp knows the goal has been completed and how would I store the data in the database?  To be clear, there will be many different types of goals like this, but all of them will be quite similar in nature. 	
3227766	What tools can I use to determine the hardware requirements of my application?	For regular readers: The saga™ continues...  My app runs fine on my development machine - which was purchased (5 years ago) as a fairly good gaming rig. As such, it's 64bit, has a 2.2GHz clock-speed and has 2GB of memory.  The machines at work however, are standard Dell issue office computers and really struggle to even start my app, let alone run it.  (Explanation... I can imagine people screaming at me: 'What on earth are you doing to require a spec like that?' Well, I'm doing a lot of real time image analysis and audio generation. So there.)  Our team has the budget to buy a dedicated laptop (needs to be portable) to run it on. So now I've been tasked with generating a minimum required spec.  What tools can I use to determine the lowest spec capable of comfortably running my app?  Update: The answers so far, whilst useful, focus more on alternatives to profiling. So I've put up a bounty to see if there is any software that'll do this sort of thing. 	
3040163	Design and Implementation stories for one feature in Scrum?	If I divide development of a particular feature into multiple stories:    First one for a high level design of the feature, Based on first story I create other stories to develop the different stand-alone pieces that compose the feature,    Does it mean I'm doing waterfall?  Furthermore - if I divide development of the previously identified stand-alone pieces into design and implementation.   Would that mean that I'm doing waterfall?  Note: I am big time Scrum novice.  	TRUE
3016702	Do version control repositories need to support search?	Is it important to be able to search your version control repository, or is it good enough to be able to search your local sources? If it is important to be able to search the repository, why is it important? 	
2545581	Metadata requirements for developers	I'm tasked with providing a list of metadata requirements our data warehouse developers might need.  This is not the business metadata (nice descriptions etc), but rather data required for change management (also known as impact assesment), data lineage etc.  I've seen this article Meta Meta Data Data - Ralph Kimball but as I'm not the first person to do this I'm throwing it to the SO community.  The actual question is this: What metadata do datawarehouse developers require to design, develop and manage change in ETL routines?  PS: I'm trying to keep the answer platform agnostic but for context this is an Oracle database with PL/SQL and Datastage. 	
2848815	What are supported clients for an asp.net webpage?	What are supported clients for an asp.net web page?  I am trying to document an asp.net website and I am unsure what I should say as far as client support.  Are there limitations for asp.net as far as browsers?  I have used IE and Firefox does it not work with some of the other browsers (chrome or safari)? Should I say the client is limited to any specific OS (I would expect it to work with a Mac or a Linux box)? 	
2834413	Use Case diagrams as a requirements gathering tool for new functionality - particularly in systems that only require very little user interaction	I'm interested in persuing the idea of using Use Case Diagrams as a tool for collecting user requirements.  However, it will be for new features as opposed to developing a system from scratch.  Also, the system only has a small level of user interaction - most of the actors will be external systems.  I want to know what people's experiances have been with using this method of gathering requirements.  How did your customers respond to the change and was it positive?  Did it just not work for anybody?  Thanks, 	TRUE
268458	Good tool to collect issues, improvements, ideas	I need a tool for collecting feedback and new ideas inside our company regarding our internal IS product. The problem is the acceptance level for such a tool. Most of our colleagues are not IT oriented, so a solution like BugZilla or Jira is way to complicated for them to use. You need to create an account, take care of a lot of parameters before submission, new ideas about new software doesn't really fit well in these tools, etc...  So, here are my requirements:      No login need, or optional. Few fields to enter. If possible a WYSIWYG editor for the main description field. Web based or E-mail based (we use outlook internaly). Free (as a beer). Not too chaotic (a Wiki is not an option)   I've take a look at uservoice (of course), it's really a nice tool for experienced people, but too complex for my target users. 	TRUE
2528402	Perl &amp; PHP project requirement	I have learned Perl and PHP.So I want to do simple real time project in this by that I can improve my knowledge in Perl and PHP.  Can anyone suggest me any requirements.  Thanks in Advance  	TRUE
2462874	Handling conflicting priorities and expectations in project development	There are any number of situations in the standard day where priority conflicts exist for projects.  Management wants maximum productivity from employees.  Marketing wants maximum salability and fast turnaround.  Ownership wants maximum profit.  Customers want usability and low cost.  Regardless of the origin of the demands, time and money are always the limiting factor in business.    Sometimes project elements have intrinsic or goodwill benefits for which there is not a hard, fast way to measure with monetary means (e.g. arguments for an attractive UI appeal vs. functional but plain).  Other elements of software may have a method of providing “mental breaks” or motivating “cool factor” for developers that can get them back on track on other bigger, complex issues.  While they may sidetrack the project short term they may have greater results long term through improved job satisfaction, etc.  Continued training is a must, but working it in can setup back progress.   What are your suggestions for setting priorities?  How do you evaluate requests/demands on your projects? What are your suggestions for communicating and passing those on to your team in a way that they stay focused?  	TRUE
2457653	PHP import functions	I'm trying to find the best pragmatic approach to import functions on the fly... let me explain.  Say I have a directory called functions which has these files:  array_select.func.php stat_mediam.func.php stat_mean.func.php .....   I would like to: load each individual file (which has a function defined inside) and use it just like an internal php function.. such as array_pop(), array_shift(), etc.  Once I stumbled on a tutorial (which I can't find again now) that compiled user defined functions as part of a PHP installation.. Although that's not a very good solution because on shared/reseller hosting you can't recompile the PHP installation.  I don't want to have conflicts with future versions of PHP / other extensions, i.e. if a function named X by me, is suddenly part of the internal php functions (even though it might not have the same functionality per se) I don't want PHP to throw a fatal error because of this and fail miserably.  So the best method that I can think of is to check if a function is defined, using function_exists(), if so throw a notice so that it's easy to track in the log files, otherwise define the function. However that will probably translate to having a lot of include/require statement in other files where I need such a function, which I don't really like. Or possibly, read the directory and loop over each *.func.php file and include_once. Though I find this a bit ugly.  The question is, have you ever stumbled upon some source code which handled such a case? How was it implemented? Did you ever do something similar? I need as much ideas as possible! :) 	
2381584	System re-design, SyRS	If you are re-designing a system, and you are writing a SyRS for the re-designed version of the system, following IEEE 1233 how do you make backreferences to 'the old design' and mention what was wrong with it?  I can think of 2 ways to do it:   The old system should be summarized outside the new SyRS, and the new SyRS should simply specify the new system without making back references to 'how it was done' in the old system. No old-system summary up-front, instead the SyRS will constantly refer to the old system and what was wrong with it inline, as the new system is being specified.  	
1115575	sed in one folder	i need 'sed' for some batch;  now there are a lot of requirements;  could anyone tell me how to put all the requirements and sed itself to run in one dir?? [so no need for install, that it works]  'Cause i need to get the batch file public, all that requirements seem to give a lot of work for the users... 	
2231658	What is a logical requirement?	An SRS should specify 'logical requirements' but not start 'design'.  My problem is in the IEEE SRS document (IEEE Std 830-1998) section 5.3.4 says:   5.3.4 Logical database requirements  This should specify the logical requirements for any information that is to be placed in a database.  This may include the following:       a)  Types of information used by various functions;     b)  Frequency of use;     c)  Accessing capabilities d)  Data entities and their relationships e)  Integrity constraints f)  Data retention requirements    So does d) mean drawing the ERD is ok?  When does specifying the system to this level in REQUIREMENTS bleed in to DESIGN? 	TRUE
2106215	Do any software developers know what the General Systems Model or an Organizational Model is?	Apparently the General Systems Model and Organizational Model are part of requirements phase of a software development project using the waterfall model (according to my professor), but we did not learn about this in my software engineering course, neither of my two software engineering books mention them, and Google doesn't seem to know what they are either. I'm not a business developer and I don't have to do any of this stuff normally, so I am in unfamiliar territory. I have to have the requirements, analysis, and design phase of a software project finished by tomorrow (it was assigned yesterday) and I can't proceed on the requirements section because my professor is requesting these unusual things for it. I would ask my professor if I thought there was even a remote chance of getting a response, but that is unlikely. 	TRUE
2016967	Ubuntu ARM requirements (CLI only)	I am using Ubuntu ARM as testing platform on a QEMU emulator. The emulator has 256MB of RAM, but I'm wondering: what are the minimum requirements for running Ubuntu ARM? (CLI only) 	
2036032	How would I word this feature and user story?	I am learning to create features and user stories and was reading this thread:  What is the difference between a User Story and a Feature in Agile terminology?  But I'm not sure how it helps here.  Say I'm writing a tetris game and I want it to be in color.  How would I write that?  Feature:  game must be in color  User Story:  As a user I want the game to be in color so I can tell blocks apart and see them easily  User Story:  As a user I want the game to be in color so that I can view my score and round clearly  that may not be perfect but is this something like how I would write this with something as basic as this?  Should I have just taken for granted things like this and not worried about it (my thought is no)?  Thank you.  EDIT:  maybe tetris isn't the best example.  I was pretending it was brand new and something that no one knew what it should really be or look like.  Is this really just artistic license that shouldn't be captured?  If this were the stories for the very first tetris game ever would you really capture this about the color feature and then break up that into separate user stories of value?  EDIT:  I guess my real problem is that I don't know basic to get when gathering requirements and didn't want to miss anything in my learning.  EDIT:  Are user stories not part of scrum and not agile?  I thought agile was a philosophy and various implementations created what we call user stories.  I put scrum as a tag because that was what I was trying to learn. 	TRUE
1779121	Domain Language: What is the best way to express?	One of my client sent me a requirement document and while reading that document there was a flash came in my mind. I started rewriting that big document similar like below. Do you think, an automated tool can generate a data model and rules by running through this. Say, if any client communicate their requirement in this approach, it will make every one to understand the domain better.  I understand that since I know what is blog and comment and post I am able to relate it easily here. However, if one chop down all the technical terms of their business in this manner, will it not be easy to make every one on the same page?   Model:   blog has a date  blog has a content blog has a author  blog has many comments  content may have images content may have links  comment has a blog  comment has a name  comment has an email  comment may have an url  comment has a date  Rules:   blog cannot be empty blog may be published or drafted blog should have a author blog cannot be deleted when comment is present blog cannot have comments after 20 days    Edit:  What I am really trying to come up here is -- once you get a requirement document and if you create a document that is mentioned here you will be able to figure out what the client is exactly looking for.   And, the other advantage is that you can use this document for further enhancements and development of the project. Or even a client can directly edit this document by hand since he now learnt how we are looking his requirements (I mean our language).   Now to some degree this statements can be interpreted in different way.   For example, I could have some tool that will analyze the statements and come up with information like if any model changes, rule changes are made it into this document.   Edit:  I am currently trying to follow this approach in a complex model like Order Management, I will update here what ever I learnt. Meanwhile, if you anyone is interested in here they can also involve with me. 	TRUE
2002686	Change the minimum OS requirments of my iPhone App?	I made a simple application, then submitted for review. After that the app details claims that the minimum OS requirmentes is 3.1.2 (I work with that SDK).  If I change my Target's iPhone OS Deployment Target to a lower iPhone OS, then could it be 'fix' my problem? Is there any risk of it? I Use some UI(Image)Views, page-flip animations, NSTimer, UIDevice for battery info, and AudioToolbox framework to have some system sound  thats all.  How can I test my app on a 2.0 simulator? Where can I find it to install? Do I need to install a whole 2.0 SDK? Where can I find it? I've googled for it, but still cant find. 	
1804995	How to deal with rapid project spec changes in a tight deadline scenario?	How to deal with a project manager that imposes really tight deadlines but with a day or so before the deadline brings in new features and spec changes to implement, with another tight deadline.    The worst thing about this is that most of the new stuff leads to major rewriting of the existing code, as previously implemented business rules are no longer applicable or 'gain' strange corner cases that need to be treated separately.   It seems that no matter how hard we try to make the system extensible, there always are things that come up literally in the last moment and need to be implemented and supported quickly.  How could I deal with such a situation? It's being really demoralizing and one colleague has already quit the team. 	TRUE
343034	Which tools you use in the initial brain-storming of the project requirements?	Other than pencil &amp; paper? I found freemind, the mapping tool very useful.  Any other ideas? 	TRUE
513230	What is the best way of formally expressing usability requirements?	I am writing a system requirements document and need to include non-functional requirements relating to the usability of the system, but am not sure of the best way to express this.  'The system shall be easy to use' seems a bit vague to me, and not testable. Are there any 'official' standards/guidelines that can be adhered to relating to the usability of a program? 	TRUE
1803136	Gathering Requirements with Scrum	My development team is working to the Scrum methodolody, pretty much. We have a prioritised product backlog, which we break down into sprints tracked by a burndown chart.   Trouble is, the product managers (who gather requirements from the stakeholders) will give us an outline of the requirements, say a few days before the start of a sprint, or set of sprints.   We then have a look through them, revise them with what is feasible (technically and within reasonable time). This gets sent off for review by management, other product manages and stakeholders, and usually revised/tweaked further, which tends to go on in a circle until it has all settled down.  Meanwhile, the sprint start date is upon us and we start grabbing at the requirements we are pretty sure are stable. Once those are done we are left with endless days of tweaking the code as the requirements shift around slightly.  While I'm aware that requirements shouldn't be considered fixed, I just feel like we are managing this badly, and trying to fit a waterfall requirements approach into agile development.   Does anyone have any improvement suggestions or experience of this kind of issue?   Edit: This is probably a worst case scenario for us - sometimes the requirements are pretty stable and we actually use Scrum properly! However, more frequently we are seeing the above scenario in our sprints, which is why I have asked the question. I know that the above is not really proper Scrum, that is sort-of the issue :) 	TRUE
933353	Requirements testing	I've just finished the implementation of my software system and now I have to document whether it has satisfied its requirements. What sort of information should I include and how should I lay it out?  My initial functional and non-functional requirements was in a two-column table and looked something like this:   FN-01 The system should allow users to send private messages to each other.   NFN-03 The setup/conﬁguration form should contain sensible default values for most  ﬁelds.  	TRUE
1631364	Supporting multi-monitors	I want to provide multi-monitor support in my application.  In the past I have had the simplistic view that multi-monitor support is simply the lack of open multi-monitor related bugs. If it seems to work on a multi-monitor setup, then it supports multi-monitors, right?  But I would like to create some clear requirements about this.  What are the basic requirements I need to adhere to, in order to satisfy most users' expectations so that they might say 'yes this application supports multi-monitors'?  For example an obvious requirement is that all windows/messageboxes/tooltips etc must open on the same monitor that the application is on. And any children of those windows must open on the same monitor as their parent.  Can you think of any more? Are there any guidelines about this anywhere? 	
1087854	Is it possible to quantify scalability as a requirement?	G'day,  I was reading the item Quantify in the book '97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know' (sanitised Amazon link) and it got me wondering how to quantify scalability.  I have designed two systems for a major British broadcasting corporation that are used to:   detect the country of origin for incoming HTTP requests, or determine the suitable video formats for a mobile phones's screen geometry and current connection type.   Both of the designs were required to provide scalability.  My designs for both systems are scalable horizontally behind caching load-balancing layers which are used to handle incoming requests for both of these services and distribute them across several servers which actually provide the service itself. Initial increases in service capacity are made by adding more servers behind the load-balance layer, hence the term horizontal scalability.  There is a limit to the scalability of this architecture however if the load balance layer starts having difficulty coping with the incoming request traffic.  So, is it possible to quantify scalability? Would it be an estimate of how many additional servers you could add to horizontally scale the solution? 	TRUE
1454213	Should I accept IE 5.0 (!) as a browser requirement for a project?	Unbelievable as it sounds, I received a request for proposal for a project which has the Internet Explorer 5.0 and Firefox 2.0 as minimum browser requirements!  We tried to explain to the client all the issues regarding such requirements, but since it's a government project and public tender, we can't influence them. The requirements stay.  They also insist that the solution is 'modern, web 2.0 enabled (?!), accessible, ...'. I can't say much else, but it's basically a public web portal with community features and a CMS background.  The project is otherwise interesting and could be quite profitable, but this requirement seems as a never ending source of frustration and problems.  	
1325672	How to ask a business user for cardinality information?	When collecting requirements from business users, I run into a point where I need to understand the cardinality between two concepts in the business user's domain.  This is usually something I want to know early in the process, since it affects database design which is hard to change later.  For example, the busines user may have a domain-specific concept of a 'Lead' and a 'Reference'. It's not always easy to get them to tell me how many References a Lead has, or vice versa.  If I was asking a DB programmer, I may simply ask, 'what's the cardinality between a Lead and a Reference?' However, this doesn't always make sense to a business user. 	TRUE
1203679	Requirements and technical design as a single effort?	I've been working on a large, multi-year project as a web architect.  So far, my responsibility has been to take requirements documentation provided by the customer's analyst and translate them into technical design documentation.  The 'powers that be' suggest that I take over the requirements documentation and combine them with my efforts on technical design.  Is there a specific problem you see with combining requirements and technical design into one step?  Note that we are already well into development, so a lot of the technical choices (os, app framework, database, servers, etc) have already been set in stone. 	TRUE
1120601	What&#39;s your development environment for JBoss 5?	I’m developing application with JBoss AS 5 with a special configuration according to my needs (Web container, ejb3 and JMS)  IDE: My Eclipse 6.5  Hardware: Apple macbook 2.3Ghz, 2Gb ram  MyEclipse hot deploy works fine, but when I need to change method’s sign or introduced new classes the system ask for a reboot of the JBoss. This slows the development process a lot. Moreover, the JBoss consumes a lot of memory (starting footprint about 500mb!). I’m wondering if there is a way to decrease the requirements for a developer environment or I just need to switch to a more powerful hardware? 	
807414	Does ASP.NET MVC require IIS?	Does ASP.NET MVC require IIS? Could I develop an application that uses the new ASP.NET MVC framework on a client machine that does not have IIS installed? 	
742662	Requirements tools with voting systems built in?	Are there any requirements gathering tools that have a voting system built in?  Using categorization is not working well as the law of the land has been whomever reviewed it last has the final say.  This has been a proposed solution to settle differences in opinion during the requirements phase of a project.  Design by committee is a well known antipattern.  There is a standard 'trick' of categorizing things as nice to have and providing an opportunity for others to realize the lack of value certain requirements have.  Unfortunately the request to allow a democratic decision process seems too reasonable to refuse. 	TRUE
596826	How to measure &quot;usability&quot; in a specification-requirements document?	Starting to look at my last year project now, and so I'm doing the specification-requirements document. Now, it just so happens that this project requires a high degree of 'usability' - I dunno if this is the right word in english, but what I mean is that it should be really easy to use from a user PoV. Now - in all the projects I've worked on so far, usability haven't really been a great factor, and so I could just write some gibberish to get around it. I always asked our teachers how they would specify the requirements of usability though, but no one have yet given me an answer I felt was good enough.  Our teachers have always preached that any requirement given on a project should be 'test-able', but how do you test how easily accessable your user-interface is?  Say I had a real-time application running. Here it wouldnt be too hard to say 'an entry should be deleted in less then 100ms after the initial call'. But it's a lot harder to say 'The userinterface should be 86% intuitive'.  I guess this is a tough nut to crack, but surely I can't be the first person in the world to have thought about this, let alone having problems with it. 	TRUE
484367	Do you print hard copies of requirements, design documents and code?	I like to print out software requirements so I can easily mark them up, sketch UIs, etc.  Do you print out requirements and design materials ahead of time or just view them digitally?  What features make for the ideal 'programmer's' printer?   Laser or Inkjet? B&amp;W or color? USB or Ethernet connector? Duplex? Availability of generic ink cartridges or toner?  	
378425	Software Requirements Reviews with MS Word - How do I get metrics in an automated way?	Let's say I have a requirements document in MS Word, and someone else reviews it an provides a list of issues found using the 'Track Changes' feature.  Is there a way to extract 'how many major/minor issues were found during the review?' using an automated script - for metrics purposes?  I see CodeCollaborator has some MS Word integration, but it doesn't seem to know how to look inside Word to extract the tracked changes data.  It just launches the document. 	TRUE
304145	Project design / specification critique, is this the right idea?	Say we are creating Acme CMS.  This CMS web application will allow you to create an unlimited number of categories with sub-categories (unlimited depth), and each category can have 0+ content pages associated with it.  So this project, at a high level will have:   Front End  1. index page  2. category page with list of content pages  3. content page  Admin Control Panel  1. categories (add/update/delete)  2. pages (add/update/delete/)  Schema design  1. tables  2. stored procedures  3. data access layer  Questions: I am using a bug tracker and Wiki, so how should I break this project down?  I am thinking of breaking each section (front end/ admin panel) down into individual pages, then writing simple user stories for each page (or theme).  When I have the user stories completed, I will then create a list of cases in my bug tracker representing features that I have to develop, along with an estimate for each one.  Am I breaking down this project properly?  Any major gaps in planning that will make this project fail (in theory anyway!)  Please provide a detailed answer, maybe a general idea of what I should do, with a detailed example explaining it and why etc. 	TRUE
307353	The Neglected Stakeholder a.k.a the System Administrator	Some time ago I came to realize that almost every customer project that I have been working on so far has neglected an important group of stakeholders: the system administrators.  These silent heroes are usually only involved at the end of a project and are left with an executable black box of bits that they have to install, support, and maintain for years to come. Whenever an issue occurs with this black box they have to find a way to resolve it using whatever random piece of information and tool support made available to them by the black box or the underlying platform, and if this is not sufficient then they have to improvise.  If they had been involved as a stakeholder in the project from the beginning they would have had a chance to predict potential problems and inform the project team about it. But reality is different and even though I as a developer would love to involve the system administrator as an extra stakeholder, external factors may prevent this from happening.  In these situations I would like to help our silent heroes as good as I can. So my question is:  What would a system administrator wish from us developers when we develop the systems they will have to maintain?   If you are a system administrator please tell a war story about a difficult problem you once had and what developers could have done to make it easier for you to solve it. 	TRUE
250050	Best programming methodology for very fast timeline and little requirements?	What is a good programming methodology for custom applications that need to be coded very fast and very customized?  I realize the lack of requirements is a problem no matter what.  Also how do you convince management to change their practices? Next question is how to you get people to stop writing 5000 line single file programs?   	TRUE
187458	Is there a systematic approach to avoid the 3 pitfalls(below) of software solutions?	 Developing software solutions which already exist and are available for re-use (either commercial or open-source). AKA 're-inventing the wheel'. Same as above, but your solution being broken. AKA 're-inventing the square wheel'. Developing solutions for problems which do not exist.   Again, I'm interested in a more formal approach, e.g. TRIZ 	
161027	Advice on splitting up a process involving multiple actors into Use Cases	Let's say I am modelling a process that involves a conversation or exchnage between two actors.  For this example, I'll use something easily understandable:-   Supplier creates a price list, Buyer chooses some items to buy and sends a Purchase Order, Supplier receives the purchase order and sends the goods. Supplier sends an invoice Buyer receives the invoice and makes a payment   Of course each of those steps in itself could be quick complicated.  How would you split this up into use cases in your requirements document?  If this process was treated as a single use-case it could fill a book.  Alternatively, making a use case out of each of the above steps would hide some of the essential interaction and flow that should be captured.  Would it make sense to have a use case that starts at 'Received a purchase order' and finishes at 'Send an Invoice' and then another that starts at 'Receive an Invoice' and ends at 'Makes a Payment'?  Any advice? 	TRUE
