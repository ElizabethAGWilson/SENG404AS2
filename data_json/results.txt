How much detail should be included in a user requirement vs system requirement and where do you draw the line?</p>\n\n<p><strong>User Requirement Definition:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>1.

On the last working day of each month, a summary of the drugs\n     prescribed, their cost, and the prescribing clinics shall be generated.\n1.2.

company on a project for their Sales department. It's my first professional programming job, but I've been coding by myself and learning for years. Part of the project involves taking some data and combining it with input to produce and graph. Then save the data...so on and so forth. So I wrote the code for this in a little under a day. The next day I showed my project supervisor, and he liked it, but \"what if we had this\", and wanted me to add something to the graph. This was not a huge change to the look or function of the program, but it drastically changed how I needed to be storing data, processing it, etc. </p>\n\n<p>Again, it took me about a day to re-structure the database table, and rewrite the code basically from scratch to support this new request. I took it back to him again, and the exact same thing happened. He requested something else which drastically changed how I needed to process the data. So, I had to rewrite it again. Finally he signed off on it, and hopefully, I won't have to rewrite it again.</p>\n\n<p>Just be clear, I'm not bashing my manager or anything like that. He's a great guy and the things he was requesting were not out of this world, they just were incompatible with what I had previously done.</p>\n\n<p>I'm just wondering if there's anything I can do in the future to avoid complete rewrites. I understand making flexible code and was trying to do so, but I would just like to know of any practices or things I could have done differently to make this easier, so, in the future, I don't spend 3 days on something that should've taken 1.</p>\n"}, {"tags": ["object-oriented-design", "requirements", "use-case"], "owner": {"reputation": 1983, "user_id": 82383, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 37, "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/687d34e2ad24ba9b5530031eb15f7845?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "display_name": "user1620696", "link": "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/82383/user1620696"}, "is_answered": true, "view_count": 2387, "closed_date": 1384433666, "accepted_answer_id": 218408, "answer_count": 3, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1518448424, "creation_date": 1384388540, "last_edit_date": 1518448424, "question_id": 218386, "link": "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/218386/requirement-gathering-and-use-cases-examples", "closed_reason": "off-topic", "title": "Requirement gathering and use cases examples", "body": "<p>I've heard a lot about requirement gathering and use cases in theory, but in practice often happens that we ask ourselves \"should we include this? should this be a use case? in which language should we write this particular requirement\" and so on.

It is not clear for me though how with Kanban, the techies understand the Story if there is no sprint planning. </p>\n"}, {"tags": ["books", "requirements"], "owner": {"reputation": 145, "user_id": 47999, "user_type": "registered", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5f7e06a7b0d6ab8017032219cf1aa4e8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "display_name": "MadSeb", "link": "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/47999/madseb"}, "is_answered": true, "view_count": 3587, "closed_date": 1380572399, "accepted_answer_id": 135677, "answer_count": 3, "score": 6, "last_activity_date": 1500118032, "creation_date": 1329526766, "last_edit_date": 1329527713, "question_id": 135673, "link": "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/135673/is-there-a-canonical-book-on-requirements-gathering", "closed_reason": "off-topic", "title": "Is there a canonical book on requirements gathering?", "body": "<p>Is there a book out there that's the de-facto standard for describing best practices, methodologies, and other helpful information on gathering requirements for software and database projects?

The owner still collects double rent from an opponent who lands on the unimproved properties of there complete colour-group.</p>\n  \n  <p>Following the above rules, you may buy and erect at any time as many houses as your judgement and financial standing will allow. But you must build evenly, i.e., you cannot erect more than one house on any one property of any colour-group until you have built one house on every property of that group. You may then begin on the second row of houses, and so on, up to a limit of four houses to a property. For example, you cannot build three Houses on one property if you have only one house on another property of that group.</p>\n  \n  <p>As you build evenly, you must also break down evenly if you sell houses back to the Bank (see SELLING PROPERTY).</p>\n  \n  <h3>HOTELS</h3>\n  \n  <p>When a player has four houses on each property of a complete colour-group, they may buy a hotel from the Bank and erect it on any property of the colour-group.

The user requirements are the tasks that a type of user can perform with a system right? But that isnt also the functional requirement?

But this arent also functional requirements? So why this distinction of user and functional requirements? Or functional requirements are not specified like this?</p>\n\n<p>Also I read that the textual use cases are used  to explore the user requirements and that then we can get the functional requirements from this analysis. So we should first identify the user requirements, like \"Search catalog\", \"Pay Order\", \"Add item to shopping cart\", Log-in\", \"Log-out\", \"Recover password\" and these user requirements besides being user requirements are also use cases that we can create to get the functional requirements? But so, again the first doubt, which should be the functional requirements of these use cases/ user requirements above?</p>\n\n<p>A use case for \"Pay order\" is for example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Precondition: The user have one or more items in the shopping cart.</p>\n  \n  <p>Trigger: Requester acceses the shopping cart.</p>\n  \n  <p>Main Flow: The system displays detailed information about the shopping\n  cart.

The user select the payment method.\n  The system informs the user about the result of the operation.</p>\n  \n  <p>Postcondition: The order is confirmed and the information is stored.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How can we get functional requirements from this?</p>\n\n<p>It is something like theese:  \"The user shall ble able to login\", \"The user shall be able to logout\", \"The user shall be able to pay an order\", \"the user shall be able to add an item to a shopping cart\"  It seems the same thing of just \"Log-in, \"Log-out\", \"Pay order\".</p>\n"}, {"tags": ["design", "gui", "requirements", "user-experience"], "migrated_from": {"other_site": {"aliases": ["http://www.stackoverflow.com", "http://facebook.stackoverflow.com"], "styling": {"tag_background_color": "#E0EAF1", "tag_foreground_color": "#3E6D8E", "link_color": "#0077CC"}, "related_sites": [{"relation": "meta", "api_site_parameter": "meta.stackoverflow", "site_url": "https://meta.stackoverflow.com", "name": "Meta Stack Overflow"}, {"relation": "chat", "site_url": "https://chat.stackoverflow.com", "name": "Stack Overflow Chat"}], "markdown_extensions": ["Prettify"], "launch_date": 1221436800, "open_beta_date": 1217462400, "site_state": "normal", "high_resolution_icon_url": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png", "favicon_url": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/img/favicon.ico", "icon_url": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/img/apple-touch-icon.png", "audience": "professional and enthusiast programmers", "site_url": "https://stackoverflow.com", "api_site_parameter": "stackoverflow", "logo_url": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/img/logo.png", "name": "Stack Overflow", "site_type": "main_site"}, "on_date": 1323145756, "question_id": 8390789}, "owner": {"user_type": "does_not_exist", "display_name": "gN0Me"}, "is_answered": true, "view_count": 332, "answer_count": 4, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1496102463, "creation_date": 1323113774, "last_edit_date": 1323668944, "question_id": 123484, "link": "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/123484/what-kind-of-documentation-should-ux-designers-provide-to-the-developer", "title": "What kind of documentation should UX designers provide to the developer?", "body": "<p>It would be interesting to hear what is used besides sketches from UX engineers during development of a GUI.

If the question can be improved to fit here, please point out int comments. If it doesn't fit, let me know also and if possible let me know where this can be discussed  because I didn't find any good forums for this.</p>\n\n<p>I've learned to program in 2009 when I studied PHP. Later in 2012, I moved to C# and .NET. Anyway, coding isn't the problem, writing down algorithms isn't my problem. My actual problem is to know <em>what</em> has to be coded to achieve a requirement and <em>where</em> it has to be coded.</p>\n\n<p>Most courses out there available on the web tackle the <em>how</em> - how to write code in a certain language, how to use some sets of APIs, etc. That's not my point here.</p>\n\n<p>In these years I've read a lot about a bunch of things: object-oriented analysis and design, design patterns, domain-driven design and so on. I understand for example the SOLID principles, some of the main ideas of DDD like the necessity for engagement of domain experts, the development of a ubiquitous language and so on. I would dare say I a <em>theoretical</em> background at least reasonable.</p>\n\n<p>But when it comes to practice I feel like I'm a disaster. Some time ago I needed to continue the development of a financial system that was already being developed by someone else. It's that kind of \"old system\" developed with C# and WinForms. It was the first time I picked a project with real domain complexity, with lots of business rules and so on.</p>\n\n<p>I confess that when I receive the requirements most of the time I think \"how on earth can this be done?\" - I have no idea on how to even get started working on the requirements to figure out what has to be done. My main confusions I believe are what I must code, what classes, interfaces and where each piece of logic goes, on which class each thing must be.  The problem is that I don't know where to start.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the times, with quite a lot of thought I end up with some ideas, but I never know how to judge if my idea is correct or not.</p>\n\n<p>I mean I don't think this is a lack of theory, as I said I've read about a bunch of thing on software architecture and object orientation I was recommended but it didn't help much in identifying what must be done in practice.</p>\n\n<p>So how can I learn to <em>really</em> <strong>do</strong> object oriented design? What I want to learn is: given requirements know how to get started working on them in a process that leads to finding out what has to be done and where each piece of code belongs. How can I also learn to judge if my idea is correct or not?</p>\n\n<p>I believe fully explaining this as an answer here would not be possible. What I am looking for, however, that may be according to the site style are answers just giving an overview and pointing some references (books, online courses, etc) that can be used to expand the ideas and really learn these things.</p>\n"}, {"tags": ["design", "project-management", "requirements"], "owner": {"reputation": 4098, "user_id": 217956, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 64, "profile_image": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/LWjjj.png?s=128&g=1", "display_name": "Frank Puffer", "link": "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/217956/frank-puffer"}, "is_answered": true, "view_count": 1388, "accepted_answer_id": 347608, "answer_count": 2, "score": 1, "last_activity_date": 1492958188, "creation_date": 1492879138, "last_edit_date": 1492930248, "question_id": 347597, "link": "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/347597/mapping-between-functional-requirements-and-software-modules", "title": "Mapping between functional requirements and software modules", "body": "<p>Let's say we have 5 functional software requirements (R1-R5).

A web application that works in popular browsers with an simple interface that could accurately produce results on the outcomes of quantum algorithms, error correction codes, entanglement, decoherence, and the other aspects of both an ideal and realistic interface would allow professionals and students alike to test their ideas and get a better understanding of the field of quantum computing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, as I am working through the book Code Complete, the next step was to list requirements. As I've never done this before and it is such an informal project, I am unsure if the requirements list I came up with is any good, or if there are improvements that should be made to it. So here's the list:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Takes in as input starting state of the qubits, each gate to be applied to which qubit, how many qubits should be used, and what implementation of quantum computing they'd like to test in (for decoherence time estimates).</li>\n<li>Outputs should be current state of every qubit and probability of |0> and |1> state for every qubit.</li>\n<li>Outputs should be given on the website and downloadable along with inputs in a text file. </li>\n<li>State of qubits should be a vector, probability should be a number from 0 to 1, gates should be one of several commonly used gates or the custom gate option.</li>\n<li>Inputs for gates should be one of several buttons (pressed).</li>\n<li>Inputs for state and number of qubits should be integer input.</li>\n<li>Once user inputs data and presses the button to compute, it should not take very long to produce the answer (e.g., one minute <em>max</em> for 5 qubit calculations is one benchmark).</li>\n<li>Should be a website interface, with input blanks based on previous user input, i.e., create an account to save your simulations (takes in email and password), then a tab to look at previous text files from simulations and a tab to create a new simulation. Then, the user would input the number of qubits and starting state of qubits, click next and it will have you list gates for 1st qubit, click done, 2nd qubit, etc. If the option inputted is custom gate, a blank pops up where you can fill in the necessary data for the gate. When done, it transitions to a \"calculating\" style screen, and then gives the result and text file to download, with an option to save and an option to start over (last option available throughout).</li>\n<li>The safety of the user's email, password, and text files must be high, as there could be important/confidential research-related information stored there.</li>\n<li>Place on site to report bugs and request improvements.</li>\n<li>Has common quantum gates available <em>and</em> a custom gate option.</li>\n<li>Simulates decoherence, entanglement, and other common features of quantum computing.</li>\n<li>Allows choice between ideal (no decoherence) and non-ideal (decoherence) quantum computer.</li>\n<li>Generalizable to large numbers of qubits (runs as efficiently as possible). </li>\n<li>Documentation on-site for users.</li>\n<li>Accurate results (basic cases, at minimum, checked against accepted results.</li>\n<li>Option to make text files public/private and a location to access public simulations?</li>\n</ol>\n"}, {"tags": ["requirements", "software", "diagrams", "use-case"], "owner": {"reputation": 1, "user_id": 257560, "user_type": "registered", "profile_image": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-1F_hU_ncjmI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABs/n13sR3y375s/photo.jpg?sz=128", "display_name": "Rudy Al-3rowi", "link": "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/257560/rudy-al-3rowi"}, "is_answered": true, "view_count": 46, "answer_count": 1, "score": -1, "last_activity_date": 1482513248, "creation_date": 1482512429, "question_id": 338788, "link": "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/338788/correct-use-case-in-s-w-requirements", "title": "Correct Use Case in S/W requirements", "body": "<p>So in S/W Requirements how to know a correct use case ?</p>\n\n<p>for Example :\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tCt1W.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tCt1W.png\" alt=\"this one here seems wrong but I&#39;m not sure \"></a>   </p>\n\n<p>this one here seems <strong>wrong</strong> but <em>I'm</em> <em>not</em> <em>sure</em> </p>\n"}, {"tags": ["requirements", "quality-attributes", "functional-requirements"], "owner": {"reputation": 104, "user_id": 150260, "user_type": "registered", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d413bc93c3344f9fe2116eddd712574c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "display_name": "Manuel", "link": "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/150260/manuel"}, "is_answered": false, "view_count": 187, "closed_date": 1411737284, "answer_count": 2, "score": -3, "last_activity_date": 1482287014, "creation_date": 1411668312, "last_edit_date": 1482287014, "question_id": 257240, "link": "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/257240/question-about-requirements", "closed_reason": "duplicate", "title": "Question about requirements", "body": "<p>I know that functional requirements are requirements that tell the system what to do while non-functional requirements are about quality and constraints.

Also, payment won't always immediately follow class selection; in some cases parents will be allowed to complete their payment later (within a 48 hour window).</p>\n\n<p>I read some articles about use cases on Alistair Cockburn's website but I'm still confused as to what the guidelines are for dividing up use cases in a case like this.</p>\n\n<p>My inclination is to go with option 3 since the system will have a wizard interface that could potentially guide the user through the registration from start to end, accomplishing the \"user goal\" of registering his/her student(s) for classes, but the \"included\" use cases could also be initiated on their own. I was also wondering if I should have a separate \"Modify Class Selections\" use case for the case when the parent logs back into the system later and changes class selections on behalf of the student, or whether that should just be an alternative scenario of the \"Select Classes\" use case.</p>\n\n<p>What would you recommend, and why?

Once an order is received Order Management application might have to interact with different applications (credit check , shipping , provisioning , activation , billing etc) depending on the order type.  </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I have an application that receives data from an upstream application. My application consumes webservices exposed by multiple other applications in order to fulfill a task. The data flows through multiple applications before reaching the upstream system which sends messages to my application. The activities that my application does are install, disconnect , suspend, restore etc using multiple services that it consumes.</p>\n\n<p>When I read posts on having system as actors, the primary aim seems to be demarcating and defining the interfaces properly. In the scenario above assuming the upstream system is A, my application is B and the applications that my application consumes are C, D, and E. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>My aplication performs install , disconnect , restrat and suspend. Are these the activities?</li>\n<li>Will the primary actor be the system sending messages to my application? I can't think of this as a role and also there no interaction between the upstream application and my application after the point when my application recieves a message.</li>\n<li>How can I define the external applications that my application consumes? as actor or activity? or i need not care about these in use case diagram?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>When you take an interaction between user and a system for shopping a product - you will list the series of interations between you and the software. However what software does internally is not specified.</p>\n\n<p>Here in my case , since it is a downstream system , the upstream system sends only one message and there is no series of interaction. Hence I am in a quandry as to how I should define the scenarios.</p>\n"}, {"tags": ["requirements", "use-case"], "owner": {"reputation": 178, "user_id": 37653, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 75, "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/116511310ca7f786b69eed374df216c6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "display_name": "geoffreydv", "link": "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/37653/geoffreydv"}, "is_answered": true, "view_count": 2002, "answer_count": 3, "score": 4, "last_activity_date": 1481487644, "creation_date": 1317241579, "last_edit_date": 1481487644, "question_id": 111384, "link": "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/111384/writing-use-cases-for-a-rather-complex-scenario", "title": "Writing use cases for a rather complex scenario", "body": "<p>I'm trying to improve my use-case writing skills but I'm stuck on a certain scenario.</p>\n\n<p>The idea is that there are a bunch of entries in a task list (some kind of todo list).

What I'm trying to achieve is basically the following:</p>\n\n<p>I have a basic class called <code>Integer</code> this class is an abstract class, the only thing I wish it would provide is basically the basic operations between integers, namely <code>+,-,*,/,&amp;,^,|,~,etc if I'm missing something</code>, just the interface no implementation. Then I would subclass such class with <code>StaticInteger</code> and <code>DynamicInteger</code> the difference is that the <code>StaticInteger</code> uses templates to describes the size of the type at compile time, while <code>DynamicInteger</code> the size can be changed at run time.</p>\n\n<p>Some use case would be the following for both classes:</p>\n\n<pre><code>StaticInteger&lt;14&gt; is1 = 3;\nStaticInteger&lt;32&gt; is2 = 15;\nStaticInteger&lt;16&gt; is3 = is1 + is2;\n\nDynamicInteger id1;\nid1.setWidth(14);\nid1.setWidth(16);\nid1 = is1;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Internally the data is represented by using arrays, so for example the resizing in the dynamic type would be achieved using <code>new/delete</code> operators;</p>\n\n<p>Basically what puzzles me is how to properly design the interface of the base abstract class Integer. Let's say I would design straightly the class StaticInteger I woudl try to do something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>template &lt;int L&gt;\nclass StaticInteger {\npublic:\n  //bla bla\n  template &lt;int M&gt;\n  StaticInteger&lt;L&gt; operator+(StaticInteger&lt;M&gt; x);\nprivate:\n  //bla bla\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The dynamic instead would be</p>\n\n<pre><code>class DynamicInteger {\n public:\n   DynamicInteger operator+(DynamicInteger x);\n private:\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but how would I specify the interface that would cover any possible interface of such operator? Between static and dynamic I think is clear that in general for a given operator the algorithm implementation could differ.</p>\n\n<p>Just a further note, I do understand there's probably a philosophical problem behind what I'm trying to do, since an operator is actually a function in C++, and to be properly defined it requires all the types specified a priory, in the base class.</p>\n\n<p>Update : Just an alternative design, I was thinking maybe I could abstract the concept of operations using a separate class (like a strategy pattern).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tfq4w.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tfq4w.jpg\" alt=\"Separation of the data Integer from the operations\"></a></p>\n"}, {"tags": ["requirements", "requirements-management"], "owner": {"reputation": 17718, "user_id": 20294, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 71, "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4769e878a86883f2241932b4ed5b1efb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "display_name": "Falcon", "link": "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/20294/falcon"}, "is_answered": true, "view_count": 163, "answer_count": 1, "score": 2, "last_activity_date": 1468937787, "creation_date": 1468917526, "question_id": 325191, "link": "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/325191/when-are-requirements-good-enough-for-implementation", "title": "When are requirements good enough for implementation", "body": "<p>I've been recently thinking about the following question:</p>\n\n<p>When are requirements good enough for implementation?</p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to create a checklist of some sort that can at least semi-objectively answer this question.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some of my thoughts about methods and checks to ensure good requirements:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ambiguity Poll (are the requirements precise enough for the\ndevelopment team) </li>\n<li>Non-functional requirements are defined </li>\n<li>Exclusive use of defined ubiquitous language</li>\n<li>\"Conditions of Statisfaction\" are defined by the customer</li>\n<li>Business Value and Technical Value are clear and communicated</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Please share your thoughts.</p>\n"}, {"tags": ["requirements"], "owner": {"reputation": 28, "user_id": 230702, "user_type": "registered", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/52be80926a4184e634a127e05c54c776?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "display_name": "Shuffy", "link": "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/230702/shuffy"}, "is_answered": true, "view_count": 442, "accepted_answer_id": 320021, "answer_count": 3, "score": 5, "last_activity_date": 1464871742, "creation_date": 1464797845, "last_edit_date": 1464871742, "question_id": 320018, "link": "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/320018/writing-requirements-when-the-task-is-to-improve-an-existing-implementation", "title": "Writing requirements when the task is to improve an existing implementation", "body": "<p>I have a specific case for this inquiry, but hopefully it can be generalized to anything else.</p>\n\n<p>I'm working with an aircraft simulator and have been tasked to implement a module whose goal is to improve the performance, if you will, of the existing module.

And it usually happens (I admit it can be just my subjective interpretation of the reality) that one tiny detail giving the flavor of good usability to our app requires a lot of time. This time is being spent on 'fighting' with GUI framework making it act like we need. And it very difficult to make estimations for this type of tasks (at least for me and most members of our team).

What is the best way to \"Formally\" write requirement(s) that capture the state transitions depicted in the diagram.  Over the years I have used two approaches and both work, but each time I work with new people there seems to be disagreements on how best to \"Formally\" capture the state transitions. \"Formally\" capture is required because traceability matrices are used that map to \"Test Cases\" and \"Software Units (ie. Classes and/or Modules)\".</p>\n\n<p>Method 1</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The system shall transition between states as depicted in Figure 1 XYZ Transition Diagram.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>OR</p>\n\n<p>Method 2</p>\n\n<p>Look at the diagram and write a requirement for each transition.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Upon power up the system shall start in the Comms-Init State.</li>\n<li>Upon establishing communications the system shall transition to the Initialization State.</li>\n<li>(ie. A requirement for each state transition)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The benefit to method 1 is that it is one requirement and very easy to write.</p>\n\n<p>The con to method 1 is that pictures don't work well with traceability matrices and it is more difficult to verify that you've covered all the transitions.</p>\n\n<p>The benefit to method 2 is that each transition can be mapped to the explicit test cases and modules in their respective traceability matrices.</p>\n\n<p>The con is that it is more work writing all the extra requirements and sometimes putting into clear and accurate words what the picture clearly shows is not as easy as it sounds. Also, the additional requirements seem to add more clutter as opposed to value, which makes reading the requirements less understandable rather than more.</p>\n\n<p>While I suspect the answer in the simple case like I described is that it depends on the project or it doesn't really matter. The issue on my new project is that things are slightly more complicated (there are modes in addition to states that interplay). Thus, method 2 will potentially explode into a lot of requirements. </p>\n\n<p>So I am asking the question because this is one of those \"practices\" that I have been doing without really knowing \"Why\".  I don't generally like to work that way, so I am hoping that someone can point out valid reasons why one approach is \"more proper\" than the other and in the process I will learn the \"Why\", which will let me understand how best to tailor for the slightly more complicated scenarios.</p>\n"}, {"tags": ["agile", "scrum", "requirements"], "owner": {"reputation": 198, "user_id": 144171, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 80, "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ec313a38a53f6f14c71190eb0fe5b8c5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "display_name": "user144171", "link": "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/144171/user144171"}, "is_answered": true, "view_count": 5857, "protected_date": 1423515406, "accepted_answer_id": 272615, "answer_count": 9, "score": 18, "last_activity_date": 1423530205, "creation_date": 1423487109, "last_edit_date": 1423530205, "question_id": 272610, "link": "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/272610/how-can-user-stories-not-contain-requirements-when-written-on-a-card-and-still", "title": "How can user stories not contain requirements (when written on a card) and still be implementable", "body": "<p>I've been told \"User Stories are not requirements, it is just a reminder of what customer wants, you cannot put requirements within a story\".

It is a manageable grouping of work which maps to what is often called a <em>Vertical Slice</em> of functionality.  And the scope of these stories can be defined unambiguously through the use of Acceptance Criteria (AC).</p>\n\n<p>So, although User Stories aren't formal requirements, browsing through them can give you a pretty clear idea of their underlying requirements.  In the short term.</p>\n\n<p>I say in the short term because, as a project progresses, the number of User Stories increases.  Thus, browsing through an ever increasing list of Stories to find a Requirement becomes less and less efficient over time.</p>\n\n<p>This problem is compounded when you consider User Stories that expand on, supersede, or even negate previous Stories.</p>\n\n<p>Now, imagine a 2 year gap between development iterations on a project (stable in production).

We own the product, and simply dictate to them some of the tasks to work on. I am one of the lead programmers and also the project manager of this particular project, so I am a programming and fulfilling requirements as well as outlining them. </p>\n\n<p>I am having difficulties communicating with the vendors exactly what is expected of them. Let me start by saying we are fairly new at this and I don't have a lot of experience leading a team of vendors, especially when it is difficult to communicate verbally in English, and they work during my night and then I come into the code they pushed while I was asleep. Problem is, I end up spending a lot of my day just checking what they did, and fixing bugs and cases they didn't think of. They're not thinkers, they do exactly what I tell them, and nothing more or less. Most of the time, I feel like it would just be easier to do it myself.</p>\n\n<p>My question is how do most teams like this communicate? Right now we have weekly telephone meetings and I email them nightly the progress I made, as well as what is expected of them. When I think \"how to communicate with other programmers\" the answer seems to be UML. That's what it is. I certainly am very familiar with UML, learned it in school, but have never really used it on the job. It's just not something we do, in fact generally the requirements for a task are in my manager's head. I can get those into a spreadsheet or a flowchart, but never an official diagram.</p>\n\n<p>Is UML something teams like this actually use? In all reality, I feel like I learned a lot in school that no one actually does. If so, which diagrams are the most useful/used? From my knowledge, in this project where we are revamping something that exists in the system already from the ground up, I feel like the following would be a good approach:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Create a quick ER diagram containing any added/updated/used entities in the project.</li>\n<li>Create a <em>detailed</em> use case model, clearly defining and numbering each use case.</li>\n<li>Create a sequence diagram for the complex use cases (as well as their alternate flows) to show exactly what is expected each step of the way.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I feel like this would be a good start. We don't really do a good job of capturing requirements currently, we kind of just start coding based on something we drew up on a whiteboard. Obviously this needs to change as well, to avoid getting a week into a project and realize that we forgot something.</p>\n\n<p>What are your suggestions/experience? Unfortunately we're sort of flying blind and just don't have anyone experienced enough in these situations to go to. I want the project to be a success, but I can't keep having the vendors (understandably) making mistakes because I assume they know X or Y.

They told me they need these these stuff from here and there, within 15-30 minutes. But they never provided a detailed client requirement document in writing. I have been asking this for number of times, but still no. As soon as I started working I realized what they told by mouth is not even 10% of the work. They first asked me to come up with my own design which is similar to another app they mentioned. I did, 100% similar design to the app they mentioned. Then they said they don't like it so they gave me their design. I completed there design and submitted it. Now they again say they don't like their own design and asking me to do another design! Apart from that, they are asking for some \"Activity Sliding Animations\", \"Windows Like UI\" etc now. In order to do this, I need to remove the entire work I did and start from the scrach, because it can be done by Fragments and mine contains Activities. I even have no idea how the backend will be. Even after one month, we are still designing and changing the designing (Because you have to send at least 3-4 mails, contact at least 2 of their team via phone to get an answer. Very slow communication).</p>\n\n<p>And will they pay for the trashed designs? I don't think so. So what about the other customers of mine which I said 'no' due to the lack of time I am going to have because of this project? I feel almost crazy.</p>\n\n<p>They always say come up with your own idea, but that is very risky in this situation. If my idea is not accepted, waste of time and money.</p>\n\n<p>I am so tired of this, I wasted lot of time designing two 100% different designing, and about to proceed to 3. Since I don't know how the software will be, I haven't done a cost estimation as well. So my question is, client is not supposed to give you any documented requirement? May be an SRS? (What I meant by SRS is, complete detailed document about functionality they need. Including these 'animation' stuff, because I have no super power to guess) The requirement doc they provided is useless, it only says \"update\", \"delete\", \"edit\". All my other clients did provide complete data, some even provided drafts of the design process, except this one. They should at lease ptovide me their requirements in details, in writing,  I need some advice here.</p>\n"}, {"tags": ["agile", "requirements"], "owner": {"reputation": 560, "user_id": 49806, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 100, "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b10abb86b2ed6d5df6c654d680115ab1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "display_name": "Wolfgang", "link": "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/49806/wolfgang"}, "is_answered": true, "view_count": 3099, "accepted_answer_id": 147946, "answer_count": 4, "score": 15, "last_activity_date": 1385239600, "creation_date": 1336589690, "last_edit_date": 1336596934, "question_id": 147937, "link": "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/147937/how-much-detail-about-a-user-story-can-a-developer-expect", "title": "How much detail about a user story can a developer expect?", "body": "<p>The biggest drawback of agile development I have experienced is that people not involved in development focus on the mantra that a user story (3-10 ideal person days) should not contain more than 1-3 sentences like:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As a customer, I can use free-text search so that I can find the products I'm looking for.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Giving this sentence, project managers expect me as a developer to commit to an estimate and develop the story. They assume that agile development means that sentences like this are all they have to provide to developers.</p>\n\n<p>I won't blame them because the well-known literature about agile development creates the impression that this would actually work. I've read something like 2 pages in natural language per story in \"Planning XP\", but that's it. Because \"working software\" is favored over \"comprehensive documentation\", this topic seems to be generally avoided.</p>\n\n<p>The reality is, of course, that if the developer is given the chance to do so, an interview with the customer brings up a long list of requirements that the customer has about the story:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>We need boolean operators like AND and OR.</li>\n  <li>We need fuzzy search an all terms.</li>\n  <li>We need to search by single words as well as by phrase.</li>\n  <li>We don't want to find products that meet criteria X, Y, and Z.</li>\n  <li>We want to sort the result. Oh, and by the way, the user can select the sort criteria in a combo box with options a, b, and c.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So you see that I'm not talking about technical details or software design or even implementation details. It's pure requirements. The longer we talk the more the customer realizes that there's actually quite a lot to say about what they want.</p>\n\n<p>But often enough I find myself in the situation that such information is not provided or in very shoddy fashion. Neither is it possible that I do the interview, nor does the person that would be in the position to do the interview provide me with a result of it.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, managers even come up with technical details like \"we want Lucene search\" but they don't want to think about if they want find only product names or also product descriptions. Sometimes I think they are just lazy ;)</p>\n\n<p>For me, this is the top issue in projects I work in (e-business web application, 500-2000 person days per project). I've addressed this problem often enough, and managers are aware that most developers have a problem with the situation. But they believe that developers are just too much \"perfectionists\". They seem annoyed that developers \"always want to have everything specified\".</p>\n\n<p>Due to the lack of generally acknowledged numbers it's hard to argue. Everybody knows how long an iteration should be. But nobody can tell how much requirements are needed to estimate and develop a story.</p>\n\n<p>Do you have some reference?</p>\n"}, {"tags": ["agile", "requirements", "acceptance-testing"], "migrated_from": {"other_site": {"aliases": ["http://www.stackoverflow.com", "http://facebook.stackoverflow.com"], "styling": {"tag_background_color": "#E0EAF1", "tag_foreground_color": "#3E6D8E", "link_color": "#0077CC"}, "related_sites": [{"relation": "meta", "api_site_parameter": "meta.stackoverflow", "site_url": "https://meta.stackoverflow.com", "name": "Meta Stack Overflow"}, {"relation": "chat", "site_url": "https://chat.stackoverflow.com", "name": "Stack Overflow Chat"}], "markdown_extensions": ["Prettify"], "launch_date": 1221436800, "open_beta_date": 1217462400, "site_state": "normal", "high_resolution_icon_url": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png", "favicon_url": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/img/favicon.ico", "icon_url": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/img/apple-touch-icon.png", "audience": "professional and enthusiast programmers", "site_url": "https://stackoverflow.com", "api_site_parameter": "stackoverflow", "logo_url": "https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/img/logo.png", "name": "Stack Overflow", "site_type": "main_site"}, "on_date": 1384437865, "question_id": 19813232}, "owner": {"user_type": "does_not_exist", "display_name": "user2960603"}, "is_answered": true, "view_count": 34830, "answer_count": 6, "score": 8, "last_activity_date": 1384444048, "creation_date": 1383744087, "last_edit_date": 1384439162, "question_id": 218437, "link": "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/218437/what-is-the-difference-between-requirements-and-acceptance-criteria", "title": "What is the difference between requirements and acceptance criteria?", "body": "<p>I am trying to understand the difference a little better as it seem like they are the same thing.</p>\n\n<p>I have work in projects with no use of the requirements and everything is an acceptance criteria, and on projects that have both.</p>\n"}, {"tags": ["documentation", "requirements", "acceptance-testing", "systems-analysis"], "owner": {"reputation": 289, "user_id": 79698, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 100, "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f8ce165f45469a3295a89e36bc3917f2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "display_name": "Tom Tom", "link": "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/79698/tom-tom"}, "is_answered": true, "view_count": 692, "accepted_answer_id": 216813, "answer_count": 2, "score": 1, "last_activity_date": 1384368862, "creation_date": 1383843853, "last_edit_date": 1384368862, "question_id": 216810, "link": "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/216810/tender-vs-requirements-vs-solution-design", "title": "Tender vs. Requirements vs. Solution Design", "body": "<p>Conventionally, which of the above documents is deemed to hold the most weight when it comes to system acceptance?</p>\n\n<p>I recently had a conversation along these lines:</p>\n\n<p>It was argued that the initial requirements / tender documentation should be used to determine system acceptance. It was said that the solution design only serves to describe the way in which the system will solve the problem, not the problem it will solve.

Furthermore, during solution design, analysis is performed to address and refine these initial requirements, translating them into a system capable of meeting the actual requirements.

But I'm still in doubt with one kind of situation. If this is not the correct site to ask about it, sorry for that.</p>\n\n<p>Well, if I have to design a system that allows one user to register customers, sell products and so on, we have someone that will operate the system, in the sense that actor is kind of obvious for some of the use cases - the actor we will consider on the use case \"Register New Customer\" is simply the responsible for that action in the company of the customer that is purchasing the software.</p>\n\n<p>Now, there are sometimes that this doesn't happen. I'll give an example: I've developed once a system to manage templates for websites in PHP. In that time, I didn't develop it within an object oriented context, but I was thinking on bring this system into object orientation to practice object oriented analysis and design. The point is that the system is very simple: \"it takes some configurations written in a xml file, takes a URL and maps it to a file\".</p>\n\n<p>The point is that there's no interaction between the users of the websites and the system. The only thing that happens is that the user requests a URL and the system selects one html file that matches this URL in some way, and embed this html into a template specified in the xml. In cases like that, the only functional requirements I can think of are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The system must allow the user to specify the folders of templates into an xml file;</li>\n<li>The system must get the information of directories from the xml file;</li>\n<li>The system must load one specific file corresponding to the requested url inside one template file;</li>\n<li>The system must allow the replacement of placeholders into the template by values specified on code;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The problem is: for instance, although I thought of them as functional requirements, all of them has to do directly with how the code must be made. Only the third one really fits what I understood of functional requirement. Also the use cases are a little complicated, every action is took by the system itself. The only use case could be \"Request Page\" with actor being \"Site Visitor\" and this would imply that the scenario would be just \"The user inputs the url into the browser window and the system loads the page.\"</p>\n\n<p>So, in cases like that, when we are dealing with code will simply be reused into some other code (this is an example, it's just a bunch of code that a developer can use to load pages independent of a template), how should we deal with requirement analysis, use cases and so on?</p>\n\n<p>As I've said, the PHP system I wrote is just an example, I'm really asking in general. Could someone give some hints or reference (some article, tutorial, something like that), that shows how to deal with this?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks very much in advance!</p>\n"}, {"tags": ["development-process", "requirements", "specifications"], "owner": {"reputation": 216, "user_id": 81398, "user_type": "registered", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc5054a478885b4fd4d5265b2fdc2fe4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "display_name": "dhblah", "link": "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/81398/dhblah"}, "is_answered": true, "view_count": 625, "closed_date": 1374687281, "answer_count": 5, "score": 12, "last_activity_date": 1374594785, "creation_date": 1374573572, "last_edit_date": 1374583812, "question_id": 205786, "link": "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/205786/what-should-i-do-if-i-dont-have-any-formal-spec", "closed_reason": "duplicate", "title": "What should I do if I don&#39;t have any formal spec?", "body": "<p>I recently was assigned to a task, but it says only a couple of words, like, do it as it made there, with no actual spec attached.

At the moment data is displayed by converting each point to a color depending on intensity, so in rather low level code. This works well. A new feature is displaying a grid and a bunch of lines that can be moved with the mouse on that image.</p>\n\n<p>As usual when new technologies are going to be picked, I made a little demo to test some things out: using the current data plot, a line is drawn on top that can be moved up/down with the mouse, and at the same time there is text displaying the cursor coordinates. I tried some different ways: using a Canvas, using a somehwat lower level DrawingContext and using the low level WriteableBitmapEx api.</p>\n\n<p>To me, there was no real difference in ease of coding nor display speed. Yes the Canvas option had a couple of lines less code than the others, while I had the impression the lower level options were somewhat faster to display. But no huge differenes making me pick one immediately.</p>\n\n<p>So the problem now is: I have no idea how to select the most suitable system for the job, but it is a very important decision to make since the graphical part of the app will likely continue to grow. Needless to say it would be a small disaster if we pick A now, and in one year we figure out B would have been way better. Normally I'd select the fastest or most convenient option, or look at future requirements and use the system that seems to fit best, but in this case there is simply not enough difference, and future requirements are not exactly known: for now we think it's sufficient if we can draw lines, circles and some text, and update speed is not that important. However the application is in it's early stage, so is the underlying hardware and there are less than 100 customers. That however, might change rapidly. And so can requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Question is simple: what to do? Some options I've been thinkig about:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>pick one that 'feels' best (WriteableBitmapEx but probably just because I have an affinity with lowlevel stuff)</li>\n<li>pick the one with the least amount of code (Canvas, also seems very easy on the UI level with effects and mouse events and what not)</li>\n<li>make a more extensive demo so differences become more clear\npick one, but put everything behind an interface so the implementation can be swapped later (might be quite some work)</li>\n</ul>\n"}, {"tags": ["requirements", "metrics", "requirements-management", "measurement", "cmmi"], "owner": {"reputation": 1133, "user_id": 58568, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 100, "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b3a32b7f6406704d6b7bb02a2b3df296?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "display_name": "David Kaczynski", "link": "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/58568/david-kaczynski"}, "is_answered": true, "view_count": 1347, "accepted_answer_id": 160836, "answer_count": 2, "score": 5, "last_activity_date": 1344971307, "creation_date": 1344958015, "last_edit_date": 1344961839, "question_id": 160820, "link": "https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/160820/what-kind-of-metrics-if-any-can-be-collected-from-requirements-development", "title": "What kind of metrics, if any, can be collected from requirements development?", "body": "<p>We elicit requirements from our product stakeholders by creating and refining user stories in monthly sprint planning meetings.

How much will it cost to me?</p>\n  \n  <p>Thank you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The request sucks, but <strong>it doesn't mean that a customer like this is not worth it</strong>. This person doesn't know how to make a request correctly, but with <strong>a bit of effort and a bit of learning and advice</strong>, this person may become a valuable customer who will not waste my time.</p>\n\n<p>For a while, I just <strong>replied by asking to provide details</strong>. They never do.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, I decided to <strong>reply in a more detailed way</strong>, explaining <em>why</em> is it impossible to give a price (except telling that it would be somewhere between $500 and $50 000). First I just made a simple explanation, telling that their description of the project is too sparse. Then I added further info, metaphors, etc., or by making comparisons with other domains which are better known by people with no technical background. For example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\u201cImagine you want to build a two-storey house. Do you believe it's possible to determine the cost of building a house just by knowing the number of storeys? You probably need to provide much more details: is it built with rock or wood? Are there solar panels on the roof? Is there a swimming pool in the backyard?</p>\n  \n  <p>A large Victorian-style house using the newest technologies, with two garages, a large terrace, etc. will cost much more than an tiny modest two-storey house for a family who really don't have too much money to spend.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It's still not working: those potential customers never respond.</p>\n\n<p>I also tried the \"let me gather the project requirements for you from scratch and do the specification and architecture, but don't forget to pay me for this\" technique, but it looks like scam\u00b9. In all cases, in my country (France), this never works with new customers for several reasons.</p>\n\n<p>Some hints show me that <strong>some of those people actually succeed finding a developer and succeed with their project</strong>. It means that my approach with those potential customers fails, while there is one approach used by someone else which works well.</p>\n\n<p>How to reply to such price requests, considering that those people don't know me, don't trust me yet, don't want to spend days writing a detailed document describing every functionality of the project, and sometimes don't even know precisely what they want, but are not ready to pay you thousands of dollars just for requirements, specification and architecture steps?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>\u00b9 Most projects are small enough and have tiny funding; most customers don't bother to know that the source code is clean and maintainable, that it was regularly refactored, and that you have unit and integration tests. <strong>They want to pay less, now, no matter how expensive it would be later to maintain the codebase.</strong> In this context, talking about functional and non functional requirements, architecture etc., is perceived like the attempt either to waste half of the customer's money doing marketing jibber-jabber instead of writing code, or to scam them by making them pay for something they don't need nor understand, and then disappearing with their money when it will come to actually writing source code.

This stakeholder is helping us directly in getting a proposal together to a group of other stakeholders for software that they have a strong need for.  Hopefully if we sell them on our proposal (consisting of very high level features and general deliverables) then they will sponsor the project and it will grow organically from there to users around the country who will see how useful it is.</p>\n\n<p>Problem is that we as a development are terribly bogged down as it is with prior projects, maintenance of existing production systems, and badly needed features on the backlog.  As it stands, because this project could be highly lucrative and there are no serious competitors, management wants to act FAST and get the most basic functionality out as quickly as possible, <strong>no matter the cost</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't realistic for us without growing our team but that takes too much time.  They are thinking about contracting the development work out, but want me to be a business analyst and also have architectural say in the project.  When they finish major feature development, they anticipate my team taking responsibility over maintenance so clearly architectural control is important as we want the deliverables to be maintainable.</p>\n\n<p>I am okay with this role, but am unaccustomed to it.  In house we typically don't use formalized requirements documents, and instead gather requirements from user stories, use cases, workflows and customer agreements.  We are used to formulating user stories but I am afraid that doesn't make sense to deliver user stories to an outside contract company as they will likely have their own project managment who might want to do things their way.  I wouldn't want to impose our unfamiliar project managment process on them if they find it alien and it slows them down.</p>\n\n<p>I am thinking that extremely detailed formalized business requirements are in order because we want to be sure that they have the necessary guidelines to create quality software, but I have no idea what kind of effort this will take from myself alone.  I am also unsure of when to start.  Nothing is official yet, but I have 90% of the information I feel I need from stakeholders.
