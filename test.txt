I do not find use-cases by nature as a way of writing SMART or good requirements. They are either not atomic, not testable, defining or depended to other system behavior, over-defining system, or defining sub-system behavior to define system interactions. I think, traditional shall statement requirements are better by their atomic nature for requirement management. However, i have seen it is also criticized as difficult to complete, when completed difficult to adapt to changes. I argue otherwise. They might be difficult to complete, but you have to have complete requirements. You might not start with a complete set, but you can complete, as you go. I do not also think they are hard to adapt changes. I think, with use cases, single change is more prone to effect other parts of requirements. But good shall-statement requirements are supposed to be atomic. With a traceable requirement management, for example any change in interfaces, can easily point to which requirements to change/remove/add. You can even abstract your requirements from the interface detail, by using symbols for interface elements, in order to increase your ability to adapt changes in interfaces.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>EXAMPLE:</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I want to further elaborate with the following example. For the sake of simplicity, the functional definition will be small.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say, i have a system consisting of 4 subsystems. System1 controls system2. System2 controls system3 and system4. System2 has the capability of powering on and off System3 and System4. System1 sends message1 to system2, for controlling system3. System1 sends message2 to system2, for controlling system4. The system that i need to define is system2. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Use case approach:</strong></p>\n\n<p>MAIN FLOW</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>system2 receives \"message1\" message from \"system1\" (Alternative statement: system1 sends \"message1\" to system2.)</li>\n<li>system2 receives \"power on system3\".</li>\n<li>system2 powers on \"system3\"</li>\n<li>system2 receives \"message2\" message from \"system1\" (Alternative statement: system1 sends \"message2\" to system2.)</li>\n<li>system2 receives \"power on system4\".</li>\n<li>system2 powers on \"system4\".</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Alternative Flow1(MF.2):\n 1. system2 receives \"power off system3\".\n 2. system2 powers off \"system3\"</p>\n\n<p>Alternative Flow2(MF.4):\n 1. system2 receives \"power off system4\".\n 2. system2 powers off \"system4\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shall Statement Requirements:</strong></p>\n\n<p>REQ1: \"System2\" shall power on \"system3\", if \"system1\" applied \"power on system3\" with message \"message1\".</p>\n\n<p>REQ2: \"System2\" shall power off \"system3\", if \"system1\" applied \"power off system3\" with message \"message1\".</p>\n\n<p>REQ3: \"System2\" shall power on \"system4\", if \"system1\" applied \"power on system4\" with message \"message2\".</p>\n\n<p>REQ4: \"System2\" shall power off \"system4\", if \"system1\" applied \"power off system4\" with message \"message2\".</p>\n\n<p>Note: I would even combine REQ1 and REQ2 as one requirement, and REQ3 and REQ4 as one requirement, since they are two distinct set of requirements, whose union defines every condition applied by the user system (\"system1\").</p>\n\n<p>I think that a requirement should be clear, realizable, testable, not-conflicting with other requirements, time-bound if necessary, not-defining with subsystem behavior, not over-defining, not-defining behavior of other interacting systems, defining in which condition it is fulfilled. I think the shall-statement requirements are good enough. You can simply realize them and just write simple test-cases and verify the system.</p>\n\n<p>For the use case statements, i think, we have to define if each of the steps in the main flow is a requirement, or if the whole scenario is one single requirement.</p>\n\n<p>If each of the steps is a requirement, then i think step 1,2 defines other system behavior if it is written in alternative way, and they are not testable, since only way to test is to ask the system if it received the message. step 3. could be okay, but what we want is that requirement to be fulfilled if step 1&amp;2 happened before. Since step3 does not reference step1&amp;2, step3 cannot be a standalone requirement.</p>\n\n<p>I think we should regard all of them as one single requirement. I find this view is more feasible, nevertheless i think, this view has pitfalls too. </p>\n\n<p>Still step 1. is defining other system behavior, or dependent on it. You might argue otherwise by saying it is a precondition of the whole scenario, but in that case step 4. is also defining other system behavior. I think the requirements should not depend on what other systems are supposed to do, rather define all-cases not depending to other systems. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, since the use case is a sequence, now we are also defining \"power system3\" operations are before \"power system4\" operations. But in the role of a system engineer, that is not something i want to define for system2. System2 should process in which order, the orders came. Sequencing these operations is over-defining and sub-system behavior, to-me.</p>\n\n<p>I tried to make the example simple. But in extensive real life scenarios, use cases are generally long, they have to define unnecessary sub-system behavior in order to be able to define system interactions, not atomic, not testable or generating test-cases is not as natural as it is with shall-statement requirements, which are atomic. Since the use-cases are long, they are composed of multiple atomic shall-statement requirements. If whole long scenario of a use case of lots of atomic requirements is seen as one single requirement, then when the related test-case fails, then how to pinpoint and document the problem. </p>\n"}, {"tags": ["language-agnostic", "communication", "requirements"], "owner": {"reputation": 5754, "user_id": 17205, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 64, "profile_image": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/EnS2w.jpg?s=128&g=1", "display_name": "Alan", "link": "https://stackoverflow.com/users/17205/alan"}, "is_answered": true, "view_count": 546, "closed_date": 1505736325, "accepted_answer_id": 169906, "answer_count": 11, "score": 17, "last_activity_date": 1550574113, "creation_date": 1223096139, "last_edit_date": 1223533489, "question_id": 169765, "link": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/169765/how-do-you-get-non-technical-folks-to-appreciate-a-non-ui-problem", "closed_reason": "primarily opinion-based", "title": "How do you get non-technical folks to appreciate a non-UI problem?", "body": "<p>Suppose you're working on an enterprise project in which you have to get management signoff in order for you to develop a new feature set.

The client want to offer the app through a native installation (which includes the JVM that the app require to run). He doesn't want to pack that resources as a folder in the app because it would create a folder structure as big as the original in the final user's hard drive (the folder doesn't take much space but it has many little files), plus the folder could be stealed easily by simply copying it. Giving this, I can't package all the app with a resource folder in a jar file, as far as i know jar files are not installables. Another requirement is that client needs certain flexibility to add some files in a installed app folders structure to add new features to the program.

Therefore, in keeping with the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwhCYaYDn8EgMjdlMWIzNGUtZTQ0NC00ZjQ5LTkwYzQtZjRhMDRlNTQ3ZGMz/view\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dependency Inversion Principle</a>, I do not want my own types to depend on <code>AATrackpad</code> or <code>BBMouse</code> directly. Rather, I want to define a protocol which describes the behaviors I need:</p>\n\n<pre><code>protocol CursorInput {\n  var cursorLocation: CGPoint { get }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and then have my own types make use of that protocol instead:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class MyCursorDescriber {\n  var cursorInput: CursorInput?\n\n  func descriptionOfCursor () -&gt; String {\n    return \"Cursor Location: \\(cursorInput?.cursorLocation.description ?? \"nil\")\"\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I want to be able to use an instance of <code>BBMouse</code> as the cursor input, like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>let myCursorDescriber = MyCursorDescriber()\nmyCursorDescriber.cursorInput = BBMouse()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but in order for this to compile I have to retroactively conform <code>BBMouse</code> to my protocol:</p>\n\n<pre><code>extension BBMouse: CursorInput {\n  var cursorLocation: CGPoint {\n    return CGPoint(x: self.where_is_the_mouse.x, y: self.where_is_the_mouse.y)\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now that I've conformed <code>BBMouse</code> to my <code>CursorInput</code> protocol, my code compiles and my architecture is the way I want it. The reason I have no problem here is that I think that <code>where_is_the_mouse</code> is a terrible name for that property, and I'm quite happy to never use that name again. However, with <code>AATrackpad</code> its a different story. I happen to think that Alice named her <code>cursorLocation</code> property perfectly, and as you can see I want to be able to use the same name for my protocol requirement. My problem is that <code>AATrackpad</code> does not use <code>CGPoint</code> as the type of this property, but instead uses a proprietary point type called <code>AAPoint</code>. The fact that my protocol requirement (<code>cursorLocation</code>) has the same name as an existing property of <code>AATrackpad</code> but a different type means that I can't retroactively conform to <code>CursorInput</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>extension AATrackpad: CursorInput {\n  var cursorLocation: CGPoint { // -- Invalid redeclaration\n    return CGPoint(x: self.cursorLocation.x, y: self.cursorLocation.y) // -- Infinite recursion\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As the comments in that snippet say, this code does not compile, and even if it did I'd be facing an infinite recursion at runtime because I have no way to specifically reference the <code>AATrackpad</code> version of <code>cursorLocation</code>. It would be great if something like this would work <code>(self as? AATrackpad)?.cursorLocation</code>, but I don't believe this makes sense in this context. Again though, the protocol conformance won't even compile in the first place, so disambiguating in order to solve the infinite recursion is secondary.</p>\n\n<p>With all of that context in mind, my question is:</p>\n\n<p>If I architect my app using protocols (which is widely recommended, for good reason), is it really true that my ability to use a certain third-party concrete type depends on the hope this third-party developer doesn't share my taste for naming conventions?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>NOTE: The answer <strong>\"Just pick a name that doesn't conflict with the types you want to use\"</strong> won't be satisfactory. Maybe in the beginning I only had <code>BBMouse</code> and had no conflicts, and then a year later I decided that I wanted to add support for <code>AATrackpad</code> as well. I initially chose a great name and it's now used pervasively throughout my app - should I have to change it everywhere for the sake of one new concrete type? What happens later on when I want to add support for <code>CCStylusTablet</code>, which now conflicts with whatever new name I chose? Do I have to change the name of my protocol requirement <em>again</em>? I hope you see why I'm looking for a more sound answer than that.</p>\n"}, {"tags": ["windows", "pip", "scikit-image", "requirements"], "owner": {"reputation": 33, "user_id": 9940649, "user_type": "registered", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/97ad279de43a4fc3b865c19228458530?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "display_name": "Sophie.A", "link": "https://stackoverflow.com/users/9940649/sophie-a"}, "is_answered": true, "view_count": 393, "accepted_answer_id": 50892195, "answer_count": 1, "score": 2, "last_activity_date": 1529187226, "creation_date": 1528993070, "question_id": 50861906, "link": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50861906/could-not-find-a-version-that-satisfies-the-requirement-every-package-no-mat", "title": "Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement &lt;every package&gt; , No matching districution", "body": "<p>On windows, I can't install any packages of these : numpy, matplotlib, skimage,...</p>\n\n<p>My python version is 2.7</p>\n\n<p>Everytime the same error :</p>\n\n<p><strong>Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement scikit-image (from ver\nsions: )\nNo matching distribution found for scikit-image</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have tried to consider 'abce' requirements, but didn't work.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you very much for helping me</p>\n"}, {"tags": ["installation", "drupal-8", "requirements"], "owner": {"reputation": 48, "user_id": 8413979, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 80, "profile_image": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/x6Cqp.jpg?s=128&g=1", "display_name": "Wisamx", "link": "https://stackoverflow.com/users/8413979/wisamx"}, "is_answered": true, "view_count": 44, "accepted_answer_id": 50878465, "answer_count": 1, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1529075907, "creation_date": 1529010791, "last_edit_date": 1529011213, "question_id": 50866024, "link": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50866024/drupal-8-just-after-installing-css-files-cant-loaded-server-error-500", "title": "Drupal 8, just after installing, css files can&#39;t loaded, server error 500", "body": "<p>I have just installed Drupal 8.5.4, like this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>get the code from the site</p></li>\n<li><p>extracted it in the s folder on my site ('katelec.com/s').</p></li>\n<li><p>create database, installed the site.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>when trying to access the site, no styles loaded.</p>\n\n<p>when trying to access any css file i get server error 500.</p>\n\n<p>the style are generated correctly and lay in the corresponding folder.</p>\n\n<p>everything went well when I disabled css / js aggregation.</p>\n\n<p>PHP Version 7.0.30\nMemory limit: 500M\nTRUSTED HOST SETTINGS</p>\n\n<p>Why I get this error?</p>\n"}, {"tags": ["python", "flask", "pip", "ibm-cloud", "requirements"], "owner": {"reputation": 95, "user_id": 4590839, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 11, "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/98dbe823b73ff891e1c59ec94f173e56?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "display_name": "Kailegh", "link": "https://stackoverflow.com/users/4590839/kailegh"}, "is_answered": true, "view_count": 36, "accepted_answer_id": 50685605, "answer_count": 2, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1528195702, "creation_date": 1528130928, "last_edit_date": 1528195597, "question_id": 50685300, "link": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50685300/local-dependencies-requeriments-txt-for-bluemix-server", "title": "Local dependencies requeriments.txt for Bluemix server", "body": "<p>I want to upload a flask server to bluemix.

It is, kind of, a mathematical proof with low enough complexity to be accessible to a human being. It has to do with accountability, reliability, auditability, etc...</p></li>\n<li><p>On the other hand, at this point, AI is a black box that seems to work very well, but most of the times we do <strong>not</strong> have a <strong>proof</strong> of its correctness (mainly because the thing going on in the box is too complex to be analyzed), it is more like a statistical certainty: \n<em>We trained the system and the system performed well for all the tests</em>.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So, some questions?</p>\n\n<p>Q1. Do these two vague thoughts make sense nowadays?</p>\n\n<p>Q2. Is possible to use AI for safety-critical system and be sure of its performance? Can we have certainty about the deterministic behavior of AI? Any reference?</p>\n\n<p>Q3. I guess there are already some companies selling safety-critical systems based on AI in the automotive realm for example. How do they manage to certify their products for such a restrictive market?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n\n<p>About Q1: thanks to Peter, I realized that, for example, for the automotive example, there are not requirements about total certainty. ASIL D level, the most restrictive level for automotive systems, requires only an upper bound for the probability of failure. So do other ISO26262 standards and levels. I would refine the question:</p>\n\n<p>Q1. Is there any safety standard in system design, at any level/subcomponent, in any field/domain, that requires <strong>total</strong> certainty?</p>\n\n<p>About Q2: Even though total certainty were not required, the question still holds. In particular, I am reading now about possible attacks against AI: I will post the links here (at this moment I can not access them).</p>\n\n<p>About Q3: Now I understand how they would be able to achieve certification. Anyhow, any reference would be very welcome.</p>\n"}, {"tags": ["controller", "silverstripe", "requirements"], "owner": {"reputation": 210, "user_id": 1400796, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 69, "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a1cdf8ea881d33fe9ba197178f669c89?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "display_name": "Craig", "link": "https://stackoverflow.com/users/1400796/craig"}, "is_answered": true, "view_count": 89, "accepted_answer_id": 44520063, "answer_count": 1, "score": 2, "last_activity_date": 1497352779, "creation_date": 1497345169, "last_edit_date": 1497347750, "question_id": 44517119, "link": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44517119/silverstripe-requirements-on-another-controller", "title": "Silverstripe - Requirements on another controller", "body": "<p>I have built an image gallery module using lightboxes and effects.

This could also serve as something client can sign as a part of requirements before programmers start coding. After the feature list is complete, I'm thinking about making this list a first column in a spreadsheet which also says when was the feature last tested, did it work, and if it didn't work how did it break. This would give me a document testers could fill after each testing cycle, so that programmers have to-do list, with information what doesn't work and when did it break.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, I'm thinking of test cases for testers, with detailed steps like:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Load user registration form.</li>\n<li>(Feature 1.1) Check country dropdown menu.\n\n<ol>\n<li>Is country dropdown populated with countries?</li>\n<li>Are names of countries localized?</li>\n<li>Is the sort order correct for each language?</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>(Feature 1.2) Enter this passwords: \"a\", \"bob\", \"password\", \"password123\", \"password123#\". Only the last password should be accepted.</li>\n<li>Press \"OK\".</li>\n<li>(Feature 2) Check thank-you note.\n\n<ol>\n<li>Is the text localized to every supported language?</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This would give testers specific cases and checklist what to pay attention to, with pointers to the features in the first document. This would also give me something to start automating testing process (currently we don't have much testing automation apart from unit tests).</p>\n\n<p>I'm looking for some examples how others have done this, without too much paperwork. Typically, tester should be able to go through all tests in an hour or two. I'm looking for a simple way to make client agree on which features should we implement for the next version, and for testers to verify that all new features are implemented and all existing features are working, and report it to programmers.</p>\n\n<p>This is mostly internal testing material, which should be a couple of Word/Excel documents. I'm trying to keep one testing/bugfixing cycle under two days. I'm tracking programming time, implementation of new features and customer tickets in other ways (JIRA), this would basically be testing documentation. This is lifecycle I had in mind:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>PM makes list of features. Customer signs it. (Document 1 is created.)</li>\n<li>Test cases are created. (Document 2.)</li>\n<li>Programmers implement features.</li>\n<li>Testers test features according to test cases. (And report bugs through Document 1.)</li>\n<li>Programmers fix bugs.</li>\n<li>GOTO 4 until all bugs are fixed.</li>\n<li>End of internal testing; product is shown to customer.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Does anyone have pointers to where some sample documents with test cases can be found?

It also won't allow linking requirements such that when a parent requirement changes, all dependent requirements must be reviewed before the change is accepted (in order to keep dependent requirements in sync).</p>\n"}, {"tags": ["browser", "system", "compatibility", "requirements"], "owner": {"reputation": 43, "user_id": 5429874, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 62, "profile_image": "https://graph.facebook.com/10207802989895167/picture?type=large", "display_name": "Felipe Felix de Luca", "link": "https://stackoverflow.com/users/5429874/felipe-felix-de-luca"}, "is_answered": true, "view_count": 20, "accepted_answer_id": 37287801, "answer_count": 1, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1463527763, "creation_date": 1463527522, "question_id": 37287780, "link": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37287780/what-would-be-a-minimum-system-browsers-version-to-run-a-simple-website", "title": "What would be a minimum system/browsers version to run a simple website?", "body": "<p>I got this job which I have to create a promotional website for a prefecture and they are asking me to list the minimum system requirements a user must fulfill to access this website.

Plus, I really like lots of blinking lights :D</p>\n\n<p>A year or so, I heard about Openstack and have been looking cursory at it since then. Seems big and complex (and scary!), and some friends who have been trying to do it at work for a year and still not quite finished/succeeded, indicate that it is what it seems :)</p>\n\n<p>However, I like tormenting myself, so I've decided I'm going to give it a try.

I need all of them.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Nova\nCompute fabric controller</li>\n<li>Glance\nImage service (for templates)</li>\n<li>Horizon\nDashboard</li>\n<li>Cinder\nBlock storage devices (can work with ZoL w/ 3rd party driver)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Less important: (Barbican, Trove, Designate)</h1>\n\n<p>I really don't need any of this, it's more of \"could be nice to have at some point\".</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Barbican\nREST API designed for the secure storage, provisioning and management of secrets</li>\n<li>Trove\nDatabase-as-a-service provisioning relational and non-relational database engine</li>\n<li>Designate\nDNS as a Service</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Possibly not needed: (Neutron, Keystone)</h1>\n\n<p>These ones I don't know if I need. I have DHCP, VLAN, VPN, DNS, LDAP, Kerberos services on the network that work just fine, and I'm not replacing them!</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Neutron (previously Quantum)\nNetwork management (DHCP, VLAN)</li>\n<li>Keystone\nIdentity service (can work with existing LDAP servers)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Not needed: (Swift, Ceilometer, Ironic, Zaqar, Searchlight, Sahara, Heat, Manilla)</h1>\n\n<p>Meh! I'm doing this for me, for my basement and for my own development and enjoyment, so don't need that. Would be nice to go with a fully object based storage, but that's not feasible for me at this time.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Swift\nObject storage system</li>\n<li>Ceilometer\nTelemetry Service (billing)</li>\n<li>Ironic\nBare metal provisoning instead of virtual machines</li>\n<li>Zaqar\nmulti-tenant cloud messaging service for Web developers (~ SQS)</li>\n<li>Searchlight\nAdvanced and consistent search capabilities across various OpenStack cloud services</li>\n<li>Sahara\nEasily and rapidly provision Hadoop (storing and managing vast amounts of data cheaply and efficient) clusters</li>\n<li>Heat\nOrchestration layer (store the requirements of a cloud application in a file that defines what resources are necessary for that application)</li>\n<li>Manila\nShared File System Service (manage shares in a vendor agnostic framework)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If we don't count storage (I already have my own block storage, which I can use with Cinder and some 3rd party plugins/modules) and compute nodes (everything that's left over will become compute nodes), can I run all this on one machine? With a hot standby/failover?</p>\n\n<p>Everything is going to be connected to the same power jack, same rack, same [outgoing] network cable so more redundancy that that is overkill. I don't even need that, but \"why not\" :)</p>\n\n<p>The basic recommendation I've heard is four to six machines. And after a lot of pestering the ones who said that, it turns out that \"two storage, two controller, two compute\". Which, is what I was thinking as well: Running this on two machines should be enough. They're basically only going to run Glance, Horizon and Cinder. And possibly Neutron and Keystone.</p>\n\n<p>Neither of them seems to be very resource-heavy.</p>\n\n<p>Is there something I'm missing?</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and nothing of this is going to face the 'Net! It's all just for me.</p>\n"}, {"tags": ["project-management", "agile", "requirements"], "owner": {"reputation": 104, "user_id": 198261, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 90, "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eb3c295eb9b2e8b444f729cfb68c9da2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "display_name": "destructo_gold", "link": "https://stackoverflow.com/users/198261/destructo-gold"}, "is_answered": true, "view_count": 173, "closed_date": 1510961920, "accepted_answer_id": 7579305, "answer_count": 3, "score": -1, "last_activity_date": 1460363435, "creation_date": 1317192012, "question_id": 7579244, "link": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7579244/agile-requirements-up-front", "closed_reason": "primarily opinion-based", "title": "Agile Requirements Up-front", "body": "<p>I understand that it is better to discover requirements through iterative approaches in Agile, however I often hear of people rejecting projects on the basis that they are given up-front requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Why is this the case?

Firstly, we have a number of different systems that hold the different things (market requirements document in files, bugs in a bug database, customer requirements in our help desk system, enginering's wish-list on our intranet, etc).  And secondly, many of the items are of wildly different size, scope, complexity and of course value, which means that choosing isn't as simple as just ordering a list by priority.  </p>\n\n<p>Because we now are fairly large, have a complex product and lots of customers, the basic solutions (a spreadsheet, a google doc, a basecamp to-do list) just isn't sufficient to deal with this.  We need a way to group things together in various ways, prioritise them on an ongoing basis, make it clear what we're doing and what is coming - without it requiring all of someone's time to just manage some tool.</p>\n\n<p>How do you manage this in a way that allows the business to always do what is most valuable to existing customers, helps get new ones, and keeps the software innards sane?</p>\n\n<p>Note that this is different from the development-side, which I think we have down pretty well.  We develop everything in an iterative, agile fashion, and once something has been chosen for design and implementation, we can do that.  It's the part where we need to figure out what to do next that's hardest!</p>\n\n<p>Have you found a method or a tool that works?  If so, please share!  (And if you would like to know the answer too, rate up the question so it stays visible :)</p>\n\n<p><I>Addendum:</i> Of course it's nice to fix all the bugs first, but in a real system that actually is installed on customers' machines, that is not always practical.  For example, we may have a bug that only occurs very rarely and that it would take a huge amount of time and architectural upheaval to fix - we might leave that for a while.  Or we might have a bug where someone thinks something is hard to use, and we think fixing it should wait for a bigger revamp of that area.  So, there are lots of reasons why we don't just fix them all straight away, but keep them open so we don't forget.  Besides, it is the prioritization of the non-bugs that is the hardest; just imagine we don't have any :)</p>\n"}, {"tags": ["security", "requirements", "medical"], "owner": {"reputation": 7536, "user_id": 51230, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 83, "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6c3348b9c0cddefb57d0ae45dcc3d1c4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "display_name": "Maksim", "link": "https://stackoverflow.com/users/51230/maksim"}, "is_answered": true, "view_count": 555, "closed_date": 1455183601, "accepted_answer_id": 756882, "answer_count": 4, "score": 6, "last_activity_date": 1370664496, "creation_date": 1239898050, "last_edit_date": 1370664496, "question_id": 756850, "link": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/756850/security-requirements-for-medical-applications", "closed_reason": "off-topic", "title": "Security Requirements for Medical Applications", "body": "<p>I'm doing research on coding requirements for medical applications but I can't find anything useful/structured.

The product I work for is a small group that has been successful for years. I just want to help them step it up a notch.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, I'm on a 6 or 7 person team with one Product Owner. She does a great job but is juggling a few different roles (as I believe is common on extremely small teams). Usually requirements are given at sporadic times (email convos, face to face discussions, meetings, etc). They are never entered into a system and sometimes this results in features missing a release or the release getting pushed back since everyone forgot about the necessary feature.</p>\n\n<p>If you're in a similar situation but you found a way to overcome this, I'd love to hear it. I'm happy to write code to help ease this situation but it can't be a web site that the Product Owner has to go to in order to get anything done. She is extremely busy and we need some way of working together as a team in order to gather these requirements.</p>\n\n<p>I'm currently thinking of something like this: Developers and team members gather requirements discussed in face to face meetings and write some quick notes on the features discussed on a wiki page. Product owner is notified whenever these pages are updated and it then becomes her responsibility to ensure accuracy.</p>\n\n<p>Pros: We'll have some record of the features. Cons: The developers are taking responsibility for something that they ordinarily wouldn't. I'm okay with that here. I think in this situation it's teamwork.</p>\n\n<p>Of course once we do this, then we're going to see that the product owner probably doesn't have enough time to ensure feature accuracy. Ultimately she is overburdened and I think this will help showcase that fact, but I just need to be able to draw attention to that first.</p>\n\n<p>So any suggestions?</p>\n\n<p>P.S. her time is extremely limited so it is considered unreasonable to expect her to need to type in the requirements after discussion. She only has time to discuss them once and move on.</p>\n"}, {"tags": ["twitter", "requirements"], "owner": {"reputation": 1484, "user_id": 691053, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 95, "profile_image": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/vRWxs.jpg?s=128&g=1", "display_name": "TryHarder", "link": "https://stackoverflow.com/users/691053/tryharder"}, "is_answered": false, "view_count": 60, "answer_count": 0, "score": 1, "last_activity_date": 1358749799, "creation_date": 1358749799, "question_id": 14433400, "link": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14433400/does-a-rating-system-violate-twitter-display-requirements", "title": "Does a rating system violate twitter display requirements?", "body": "<p>I'm confused about the new <a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/terms/display-requirements\" rel=\"nofollow\">twitter display requirements</a>. </p>\n\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>\n\n<p>I dynamically generate a page with a series of tweets based on their popularity.

Our 'user stories' just consist of what part of the application we will be customizing in the specific sprint and also what systems we will integrate with internally. The integration with different systems normally works pretty well because we can start working on that right away. The 'customize x screen' are the main problems areas because the developers can't do anything from that. We have to wait until we get the requirements from the BAs before we can really do anything.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT: More insight/confusion perhaps:</strong>\nI wonder if part of the problem is that the screen that are being customized are already there as this is a COTS product that is being heavily customized. People suggest that the user stories should be along the lines of 'make a screen that does X'. That's already done. Maybe there isn't a good way to do user stories for these requirements... maybe this need to be a whole new question.</p>\n"}, {"tags": ["documentation", "report", "methodology", "requirements"], "owner": {"reputation": 954, "user_id": 1004413, "user_type": "registered", "accept_rate": 66, "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c78a511f5bbe8e6551d0c11e33e8c1b3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "display_name": "user1004413", "link": "https://stackoverflow.com/users/1004413/user1004413"}, "is_answered": true, "view_count": 1721, "closed_date": 1517082918, "answer_count": 1, "score": 3, "last_activity_date": 1334395438, "creation_date": 1334391932, "last_edit_date": 1334395438, "question_id": 10152163, "link": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10152163/is-validation-of-user-input-part-of-functional-requirements", "closed_reason": "primarily opinion-based", "title": "Is validation of user input part of functional requirements?", "body": "<p>I am using the FURPS+ model for my requirements.

For example, the combination of conditions and events that would trigger the airbag deployment changed every couple weeks during development. We hated to change that piece of code so often.</p>\n\n<p>At that time, I attended the Embedded Systems Conference and heard a brilliant presentation by Stephen Mellor called \"Coping with changing requirements\". You can read the paper <a href=\"http://www.techonline.com/learning/techpaper/197801730\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> (they make you sign-up but it's free).</p>\n\n<p>The main idea of this was to implement the core behavior in your code but configure the specific details in the form of data. The data is something you can change easily and it can even be programmable in EEPROM or a different section of flash.</p>\n\n<p>This idea sounded great to solve our problem. I shared this with my colleague and we immediately started reworking some of the SW modules.</p>\n\n<p>When trying to use this idea in our coding, we encountered some difficulty in the actual implementation. Our code constructs got terribly heavy and complex for a constrained embedded system.</p>\n\n<p>To illustrate this I will elaborate on the example I mentioned above. Instead of having a a bunch of if-statements to decide if the combination of inputs was in a state that required an airbag deployment, we changed to a big table of tables. Some of the conditions were not trivial, so we used a lot of function pointers to be able to call lots of little helper functions which somehow resolved some of the conditions. We had several levels of indirection and everything became hard to understand. To make a long story short, we ended up using a lot of memory, runtime and code complexity. Debugging the thing was not straightforward either. The boss made us change some things back because the modules were getting too heavy (and he was maybe right!).</p>\n\n<p>PS: There is a similar question in SO but it looks like the focus is different. <a href=\"http://www.stackoverflow.com/questions/466081/adapting-to-meet-changing-business-requirements/983387#983387\">Adapting to meet changing business requirements?</a></p>\n"}, {"tags": ["php", "video-streaming", "requirements"], "owner": {"reputation": 1, "user_id": 1153605, "user_type": "registered", "profile_image": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/691e7a8813c9484207817e11e9cd3d30?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "display_name": "senthil kumar", "link": "https://stackoverflow.com/users/1153605/senthil-kumar"}, "is_answered": false, "view_count": 1380, "answer_count": 2, "score": 0, "last_activity_date": 1326801343, "creation_date": 1326794746, "last_edit_date": 1326799003, "question_id": 8892733, "link": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8892733/php-requirements-for-creating-a-live-video-streaming", "title": "PHP.

(Not ideal for requirement management, but at least its a start.)</p>\n\n<p>What I'm doing is creating a &lt;<em>functionalSpec></em> tag for each functional specification I am currently reading through. I create a &lt;<em>requirement></em> tag for each requirement I find. Since I want to be able to trace where the requirement came from, I create a &lt;<em>trace></em> element with the <em>id</em> of the &lt;<em>functionalSpec></em> element. Instead of allowing myself to enter any plain-old-text in the &lt;<em>functionalSpecId></em> tag, I want the XSD to validate and make sure that I only enter in an <em>id</em> that exists for an existing functional spec. My problem is coming in where it seems the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-1/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">XML Schema W3C Recommendations</a> documentation says that what I want to do is not possible. (about 1/2 way down)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>{selector} specifies a restricted XPath ([XPath]) expression <strong>relative to instances of the element being declared</strong>. This must identify a node set of subordinate elements (i.e. contained within the declared element) to which the constraint applies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm using Oxygen to create this since I'm fairly new to XSD files, and it gives me the following error:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>E [Xerces] Identity Constraint error:  identity constraint \"KeyRef@1045a2\" has a keyref which refers to a key or unique that is out of scope.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So my question is does anyone know of a way that will allow me to use the same XML structure that I have below through using

Since the deadlines are short, the current dev team don't want to spend time on such things.

I was surprised how they have managed to go so far (more than 4 months) without requirements, but this is what we have now. I believe that the way they have chosen is the most sure one to kill the product which has a good marketing value.</p>\n\n<p>Am I right, and what would you do in a similar circumstances to prove the dev team/management to make use-cases/requirements before moving forward?

I would also encourage customers and developers to pick them up and put them next to the iteration board each time they think a card could be useful as a reminder for the team.</p>\n\n<p>Have you ever tried any similar approach?

Although that's not a very good solution because on shared/reseller hosting you can't recompile the PHP installation.</p>\n\n<p>I don't want to have conflicts with future versions of PHP / other extensions, i.e. if a function named X by me, is suddenly part of the internal php functions (even though it might not have the same functionality per se) I don't want PHP to throw a fatal error because of this and fail miserably.</p>\n\n<p>So the best method that I can think of is to check if a function is defined, using function_exists(), if so throw a notice so that it's easy to track in the log files, otherwise define the function. However that will probably translate to having a lot of include/require statement in other files where I need such a function, which I don't really like.
